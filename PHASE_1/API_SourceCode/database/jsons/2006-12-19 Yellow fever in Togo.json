Yellow fever has been laboratory confirmed in the three cases (males aged 9, 15 and 20) by Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal. A team from the Ministry of Health and the WHO country office are currently carrying out a field investigation. Since the most recent mass vaccination campaign in this area was conducted in 1987, there are concerns for a highly susceptible population. The Ministry of Health will be requesting additional vaccine from the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Yellow fever Control to carry out a mass vaccination campaign, with the support of WHO and UNICEF. A stockpile of 6 million doses of yellow fever vaccine is provided annually by the GAVI Alliance to rapidly respond to outbreaks.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "yellow fever"]}
