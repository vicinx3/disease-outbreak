Since the beginning of June, 2464 cholera cases have been registered. These figures do not include mild cases for which data is not currently available, and underestimates the number of cases for the months of June, July and August. To date, the number of deaths is unobtainable. This epidemiological information is based on data provided by M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res Belgium and France and MERLIN who have been working in Monrovia during the outbreak. As reported previously, it is likely that an increase in cases will occur in the coming weeks because of the movement of people, overcrowded living conditions in central Monrovia and the lack of safe water.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "cholera"]}
