In January, all provinces were affected, and although only 75% of provinces were affected in May, there was a significant increase in some (especially Karusi, with 2.5 times more cases in May than in April). A comparison of data for May 1998 and May 1999 has shown that in some provinces, cases have increased very sharply (e.g. Mutoyi, from 3\u00a0094 to 7 568; Rutoke, from 293 to 1\u00a0768). Figures concerning the number of deaths are not available for all provinces. In Mutoyi, a total of 17 deaths was registered between January and May; in Karusi, 34 deaths were recorded between 15 May and 15 June. The local health authorities have taken the necessary measures to mobilize resources for drug procurement, reinforced epidemiological surveillance and vector control.", "key_terms": ["malaria"]}
