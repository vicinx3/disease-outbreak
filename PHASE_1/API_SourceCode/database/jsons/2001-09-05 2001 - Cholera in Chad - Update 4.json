Please note that the increase in the total number of cases (1099) from the last report on 21 August does not necessarily indicate that the increase occurred during this two-week period. Rather, it is the result of late reporting of data. The Ministry of Health, with the assistance of WHO and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, is continuing its surveillance efforts. There is an ongoing outbreak of cholera across Chad's border, in the northern part of Cameroon.\u00a0 The Ministry of Health of Cameroon has reported a total number of 158 cases, including 3 deaths.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "cholera"]}
