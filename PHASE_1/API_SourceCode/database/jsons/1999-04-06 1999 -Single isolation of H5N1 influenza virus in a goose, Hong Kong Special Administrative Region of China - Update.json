Preliminary characterization indicates that the haemagglutinin (HA) gene is 98.9% homologous with the H5N1 influenza virus isolate from a child in Hong Kong SAR in 1997 \u2013 A/Hong Kong/156/97. Although the neuraminidase (NA) is of the subtype N1 the internal genes are quite distinct from the 1997 H5N1 isolate and are most closely related to gene segments of influenza viruses isolated in the early 1990s from ducks in China and chickens in Italy. The pathogenicity in chickens of the H5N1 isolated in 1999 appears to be lower than that of the 1997 H5N1 isolates.", "key_terms": ["virus"]}
