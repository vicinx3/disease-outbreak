So far, three districts have crossed the epidemic threshold, including a district in the capital, N'Djamena, while five districts are on alert. Thirty three specimens of cerebral spinal fluid have been found positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W135 and 30 specimens for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, by latex, culture and PCR, suggesting that both serogroups are responsible for the epidemic.
