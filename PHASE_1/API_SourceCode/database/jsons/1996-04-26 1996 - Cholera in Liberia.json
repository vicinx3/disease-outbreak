Of particular concern is that under the chaotic conditions, a recent outbreak of cholera in Monrovia could quickly spread. On Monday, a WHO team confirmed the presence of cholera in the BTC district of Monrovia. Forty-seven cases have also been reported at the IDP compound in Greystone. A WHO consignment of emergency medicine was airlifted by helicopter from Freetown to Monrovia. The WHO country representative in Liberia is working closely with the Ministry of Health, partner UN agencies and three local nongovernmental organizations to distribute the new supplies to hospitals and health centres in Monrovia and re-organize emergency services. WHO is also working to limit the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases in the city due to the hazardous water and sanitation conditions, and to strengthen locally available technical capacities to respond to epidemics. Cholera was also reported from the following countries in the past week: Mali, Niger, Togo and Zaire.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "infectious", "other", "cholera"]}
