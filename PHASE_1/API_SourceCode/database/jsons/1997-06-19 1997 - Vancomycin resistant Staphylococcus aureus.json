Dr Keiichi Hiramatsu of Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan, who described the characteristics of the vancomycin-resistant strain, has provided a summary and a provisional method for detection available on EMC's web site for Antimicrobial Resistance. An account of his findings will be published in Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy in July 1997.", "key_terms": ["other"]}
