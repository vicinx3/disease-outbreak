WHO is working closely with the national authorities of the involved countries (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom) and international partners in order to better understand the public health risk from the novel coronavirus. From the information available thus far, it appears that the novel coronavirus cannot be easily transmitted from person-to-person. Given the severity of the two laboratory confirmed cases, WHO is continuing to monitor the situation in order to provide the appropriate response, expertise and support to its Member States. Rapid progress has been made in the characterization of the novel coronavirus, and in the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays. WHO is collaborating with partner laboratories to make these available as quickly as possible. It is anticipated that the first batch of reagents, together with information and testing algorithms, will be available for urgent testing within the coming days. Tests for novel coronavirus infection of patients under investigation - based on the case definition issued by WHO \u2013 are currently available by some partner laboratories. National Health Authorities can contact these laboratories through WHO. WHO continues to inform its Member States through the designated National Focal Points under the International Health Regulations (2005). No travel or trade restrictions have been recommended by WHO for Saudi Arabia or Qatar with respect to the novel coronavirus infections.", "key_terms": ["infection", "virus"]}
