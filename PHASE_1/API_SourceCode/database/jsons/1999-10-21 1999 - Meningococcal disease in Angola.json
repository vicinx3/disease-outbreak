Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A was detected by latex test. Due to the current security situation, an assessment team which visited the area in mid-October was not able to examine patients or collect samples for laboratory diagnosis. However, according to information sources considered to be reliable, clinical features observed by witnesses were compatible with cerebrospinal meningitis. The majority of cases occurred in the age group 18-25 years, with no sex distinction. Reports refer to 253 cases with 147 deaths. It should be noted that 92% of the cases reported had no access to municipal health.", "key_terms": ["outbreak"]}
