Cases have recently been detected in two rural health centres close to Bujumbura, Maramvya and Gatumba. Efforts to provide medical supplies and safe water to rural areas have probably succeeded in decreasing the inflow of cases to the hospital in Bujumbura. The rural health centre in Marmvya has received MSF support and UNICEF has provided water to five camps around the health centre. Gatumba health facility received from a visiting WHO team an emergency stock for treatment of the severe cases of dehydration but the centre lacks water and only a limited number of cases can be treated. Information is not available from other health centres around Bujumbura where the current security situation prevent visits by health teams. The epidemic appears to be under control but the preacarious security situation and potential massive population displacements contribute to a continued threat of new outbreaks.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "other"]}
