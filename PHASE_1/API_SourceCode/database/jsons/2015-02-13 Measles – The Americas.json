A total of 121 measles cases have been reported in the Unites States of America from 1 January to 6 February 2015 in 17 states and Washington, DC: Arizona (7) California (88) Colorado (1) District of Columbia (1) Delaware (1) Illinois (3) Michigan (1) Minnesota (1) Nebraska (2) New Jersey (1) New York (2) Nevada (2) Oregon (1) Pennsylvania (1) South Dakota (2) Texas (1) Utah (2) Washington (4) For cases with ages reported, the age of case-patients range from less than 12 months to 59 years old (median = 19 years old). The majority of cases (103) are linked to an amusement park in California, which they visited between 17 and 20 December 2014. The outbreak likely started from a traveler who became infected overseas with measles and visited the amusement park while infectious; however, no source has been identified. Canada is investigating two separate measles outbreaks. On 3 February, the Lanaudiere Public Health Department of the Agency for Health and Social Services in Quebec province reported a total of 8 suspected cases of measles since the beginning of 2015. These suspected cases are members of the same family, who are unimmunized for religious reasons. They are linked to the current outbreak in the United States. On 2 February 2015, in Ontario province, the Toronto Public Health reported 4 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles, involving 2 children under the age of two and 2 adults from four different families. As of yet, no source has been identified and there are no known links or contact between the cases. Contact tracing of exposed contacts is underway for the two outbreaks. The Mexico IHR National Focal Point reported 2 imported cases of measles with history of travel to the United States. The first case is a 22-month-old female from Baja California Sur, Mexico (rash onset 30 December 2014) with history of travel to California from 16 to 18 December 2014. The second case is a 37-year-old, unvaccinated female from Nueva Le\u00f3n state (rash onset 13 January 2015), whose only history of recent travel was to San Francisco, California from 26 to 31 December 2014.
