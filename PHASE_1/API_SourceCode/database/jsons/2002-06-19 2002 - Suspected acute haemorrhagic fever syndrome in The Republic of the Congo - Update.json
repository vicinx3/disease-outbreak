No new cases have been reported since the last death on 6 June. The investigation has been hampered by the lack of community cooperation and increased emphasis will be placed on social mobilization activities. The epidemiological pattern of this cluster and the clinical signs of the suspected cases were consistent with the previous outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the area, but since no samples have been collected, there has been no laboratory confirmation.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "ebola", "ebola haemorrhagic fever"]}
