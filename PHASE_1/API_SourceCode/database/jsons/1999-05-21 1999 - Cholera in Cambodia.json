Four districts in this province, which is one of Cambodia's least populated areas, have been affected to date. The outbreak started on 16 April and a total of 874 cases with 56 deaths was reported up to 16 May. Lack of good hygiene and sanitation facilities, as well as difficulty in sending supplies because of poor road conditions in the area, are contributing to the spread of the epidemic. The Ministry of Health is providing oral rehydration salts and antibiotics and is also organizing health education campaigns for the affected and surrounding villages. Cholera is endemic in Cambodia and 1197 cases and 66 deaths were notified to WHO in 1998.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "cholera"]}
