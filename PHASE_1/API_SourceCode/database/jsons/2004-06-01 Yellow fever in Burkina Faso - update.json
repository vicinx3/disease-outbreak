However, there is a high risk of a major urban outbreak of yellow fever in Bobo-Dioulasso in the immediate future. The rainy season is just beginning and the vector for yellow fever in an urban setting, Aedes aegypti, is already present in the district. Bobo-Dioulasso, with a population of 740 192, is densely populated and vaccination coverage against yellow fever is low. The district is also a busy crossroads for population movements across West Africa. For these reasons, WHO strongly recommends a mass vaccination campaign in Bobo-Dioulasso as soon as possible.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "yellow fever"]}
