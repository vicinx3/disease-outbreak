So far, seven districts have crossed the epidemic threshold (B\u00e9bidja, B\u00e9djondo, B\u00e9r\u00e9, Doba, Dono-Manga, Goundi and La\u00ef) while three others crossed the alert threshold (B\u00e9noye, Laokassi and Sarh). Sixty seven specimens of cerebral spinal fluid have been found positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A by latex test while 14 specimens were found positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W135, by latex, and culture. This indicates that some areas are experiencing mixed epidemics (Dono-Manga), while others are being predominantly affected by either serogroup A (Doba, B\u00e9bidja district ) or serogroup W135 (Goundi district). The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has provided 157,000 doses of trivalent ACW vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign in affected areas of Dono-Manga and Goundi as well as 282,000 doses of bivalent vaccine for mass vaccination in Doba and Bebidja. Vaccines are being provided with the support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). Vaccination campaigns have been completed or are being conducted in B\u00e9bidja and Doba district, while others will take place shortly in Dono-Manga and Goundi districts. WHO, UNICEF, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res and the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) are working with the Ministry of Health, Chad to implement the vaccination campaigns as well as other emergency control measures, including case management and surveillance in neighbouring districts.", "key_terms": ["epidemic", "other"]}
