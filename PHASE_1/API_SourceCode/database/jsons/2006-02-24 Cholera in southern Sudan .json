Vibrio cholera Inaba has been laboratory confirmed in several stool samples by African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) laboratories in Nairobi. While transmission seems to be declining in Yei town, the outbreak in Juba town is expected to increase in the coming days. A task force under the Ministry of Health of the Government of Southern Sudan (MOH/GoSS), including the Federal Ministry of Health and WHO, has been established to coordinate the overall public health response. Several control measures are being implemented to contain the outbreak. These include strengthening the surveillance and reporting system, standardizing case management and promoting health education and hygiene, with the chlorination of public water supplies. For more details about these measures, please see the web site of the WHO Country Office in Sudan.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "cholera"]}
