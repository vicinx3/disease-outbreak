Other States affected include White Nile (197 cases,15 deaths), South Kordofan and Sennar (where incidence was lower). The national task force in Khartoum has coordinated and led epidemic response activities. A total of 70\u00a0000 people were vaccinated in early March and there is a contingency stock of vaccines and injection material for around 200\u00a0000 more on standby in Juba. The task force also considered how to improve the decentralization of case management and surveillance as tools for epidemic management, and was concerned by the shortage of stock of autodestruct injection material at national level. In the districts of Akobo and Wanding, response by Federal and State health authorities is being supported by M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.", "key_terms": ["epidemic", "other"]}
