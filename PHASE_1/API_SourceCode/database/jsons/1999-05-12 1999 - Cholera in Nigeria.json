The outbreak was traced to the interruption of the domestic water supply for some days which forced people to use any water available. A total of 815 cases with 28 deaths has been recorded up to 6 May. The outbreak has now spread to Tofa LGA where 182 cases with 19 deaths were recorded over two weeks beginning in late April. Control measures including management and isolation of affected patients, intensification of health education and chlorination of all wells in affected communities have been taken. WHO gave technical support during the investigation and management of the outbreak as well as emergency health kits. Cholera outbreaks also occurred recently in Adamawa State (76 cases, 18 deaths) and in Edo State (49 cases 24 deaths). The outbreak in Adamawa State is now under control and no new cases have been reported in May. In Edo State technical assistance and transportation for the investigative team was given by WHO but basic drugs and supplies for management of patients were not available which led to the high case fatality rate. Medecins sans fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Holland, has set up a temporary treatment centre and 6 Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) centres, and are currently organizing a widespread health education campaign and training of local district health personnel.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "cholera"]}
