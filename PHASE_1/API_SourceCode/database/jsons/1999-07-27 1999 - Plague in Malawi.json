Up to 21 July, 74 suspect cases had been reported from a total of 22 villages. Six villages along the Mozambican border were the most affected reporting around 3 to 4 suspect cases each. Some of the other villages reported only one suspect case each. The treatment of patients is under way as well as environmental control measures which include spraying and dusting of affected and surrounding housing areas, health education on proper storage of foodstuffs and refuse disposal. The situation was being handled effectively by the Ministry of Health but drug supplies have been depleted and more may be needed. WHO has offered its assistance to the national health authorities. The last outbreak of plague in Malawi was in 1997 when a total of 582 cases were reported including cases in Nsanje, Chikwawa and Ntchisi Districts, all in Southern Region.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "plague", "other"]}
