Among the serologically confirmed cases, 32% had meningitis, 45% meningoencephalitis and 21% encephalitis. Most cases (71%) were from rural areas and originated from the Districts of Dolj, Galati and Constanta in the south. The remainder were from six sectors of Bucharest where the highest incidence rate (12,2 per 100,000 population) was registered in a sector where the population lives mainly in houses with gardens.
