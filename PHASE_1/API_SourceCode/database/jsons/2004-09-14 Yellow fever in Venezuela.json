The cases occurred in the second half of August 2004, in the Municipality of Sucre, Merida State. A team from the Ministry of Health was quickly deployed to investigate the area and organized a catch-up vaccination campaign to prevent the occurrence of cases. Last year Venezuela started a programme to vaccinate 10 million people in 17 states considered to be at risk from yellow fever.
