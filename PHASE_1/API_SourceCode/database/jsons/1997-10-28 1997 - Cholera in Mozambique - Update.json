The cases have mainly been reported in five quarters of Maputo city (Chamanculo, Mafalala, Polana Cani\u00e7o, Maxaquene and Zona Verde), all with very poor sanitary conditions and problems with safe water. Up to now no other province of the country has notified cases and Maputo city is the only area affected in the country. Control activities through the Ministry of Health include mass media messages, community based activities, house-to-house visits and treatment of cases. The Ministry also coordinates activities with the institutions responsible for sanitation and water supply and is recommending further government action to improve sanitiation in the affected quarters. WHO has financially supported the education campaigns and other community activities while UNICEF has provided 80 cholera kits with 320 more kits expected to arrive soon. The National Cholera Commission is meeting weekly and includes representatives of both WHO and UNICEF.", "key_terms": ["other", "cholera"]}
