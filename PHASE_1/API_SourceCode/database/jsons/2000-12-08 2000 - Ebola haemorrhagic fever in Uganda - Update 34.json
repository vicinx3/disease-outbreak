While the international response to the outbreak has progressed beyond the initial acute phase there is continued need for intensive measures to control and contain the outbreak. The situation in Masindi requires particular attention and the Ugandan Ministry of Health has appealed\u00a0 for volunteers to assist in the following areas: disease surveillance and control tracing; transportation of the dead; social mobilization; infection control; clinical care of patients.
