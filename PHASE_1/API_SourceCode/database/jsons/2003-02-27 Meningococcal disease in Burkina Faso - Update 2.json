Of the 53 districts in Burkina Faso, 7 districts have reached the epidemic threshold: Batie, Bogande, Bousse, Manga, Pama, Po and Zabre and 9 districts are in the alert phase: Barsalogho, Boulsa, Dano, Koudougou, Leo, Nanoro, Sapone, Tenkodogo and Zorgho, The incidence overall is still increasing. Preliminary results from samples tested indicate Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A and W135. The Ministry of Health, which has established a Crisis Committee, is implementing measures to control the outbreak: reinforcement of the epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, case management with oily chloramphenicol and a mass vaccination campaign. The vaccination campaign is ongoing in Batie, Manga and Bogande. WHO, with its partners in the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG), is providing Burkina Faso with the ACW135 trivalent vaccine. As the global stock of trivalent vaccine is currently limited to 2 million doses, if the campaign is extended throughout the country, funds will be needed to produce additional vaccine.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic"]}
