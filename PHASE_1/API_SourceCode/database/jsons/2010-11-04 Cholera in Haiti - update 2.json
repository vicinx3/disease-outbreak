The departments where confirmed cases have been reported include Artibonite, Centre, Nord, Nord-Ouest, and Ouest. Laboratory test on the cholera strain linked to the current outbreak in Haiti conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta showed that it is most similar to cholera strains found in South Asia. PAHO/WHO and health partners continue to support the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population in their response to the cholera outbreak. Priority is given to measures for protection of families at the community level, strengthening primary health care centers already operating across the nation, and establishing a network of special cholera treatment centers and designated hospitals for treatment of severe cases. Current preventive measures being used to control the outbreak include treating ill people with oral rehydration solution, providing access to safe water, and encouraging good hygiene and sanitation practices.
