In the animal population, analysis conducted by the National Veterinary Research Laboratory shows virus circulation in several regions of the country. A multi-sector task force has been jointly established by the MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development to respond to this outbreak. WHO and partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), are working within the task force to strengthen epidemiological surveillance in both human and animal health, strengthen capacity in case management at health care facilities, strengthen health measures in slaughterhouses, and raise awareness among farmers. A multi-sector investigation team has been deployed to conduct a detailed outbreak investigation among humans and animals in the affected areas. An international team of experts will be deployed to provide technical assistance from 3 to 10 November 2012. Mauritania experienced an outbreak of RVF in 2010.
