In a one week period from 4 to 11 February, a total of 79 suspected cases including 8 deaths were reported. However, delayed and irregular reporting as well as incomplete disaggregated population data are leading to difficulties in determining whether districts in these areas have reached the epidemic threshold. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected from the 8 affected states have tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A by latex test. Medicines for case management as well as emergency supplies for outbreak investigations and technical guidance on outbreak control and management have been provided by the Ministry of Health of the Government of Southern Sudan with the assistance of WHO and partners, including UNICEF, UN Office of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and MEDAIR.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic"]}
