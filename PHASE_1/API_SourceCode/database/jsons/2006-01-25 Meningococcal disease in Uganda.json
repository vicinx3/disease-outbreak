Four cerebral spinal fluid specimens were positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A by latex test. Two of these were also confirmed by culture at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Uganda. The Ministry of Health has constituted a National Task force, including M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, UNICEF and WHO to plan and coordinate the response. WHO is also supporting the Ministry of Health in their field investigations in affected and surrounding districts (Kitgum and Moroto) and in strengthening surveillance."}
