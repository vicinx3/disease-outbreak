Vibrio cholerae biotype El Tor serotype Ogawa has been identified (see previous report). The public health authorities of the Federated States of Micronesia with the support of WHO and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), have decided to implement a cholera vaccination campaign in the unaffected islands, using the live oral CVD-103HgR vaccine.\u00a0 Several clinical studies have shown that one oral dose of this vaccine provides 70-90% protective immunity after only seven days. Although the outbreak is still ongoing, it is limited to Pohnpei island.\u00a0 However, the cholera vaccination campaign is a preventive measure to contain the spread of cholera to other areas. This cholera vaccine campaign does not replace the usual recommendations for safe water, appropriate sanitation and environmental measures, but is rather a complementary tool to contain the cholera outbreak in this specific situation.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "other", "cholera"]}
