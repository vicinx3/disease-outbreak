All 3 persons were infected while on holiday in December in the National Park of Chapada dos Veadeiros, Alta Paraiso, Goias State, located approximately 250 km north of Brasilia. The park is in a forested area where yellow fever is known to be endemic, thus these cases resulted from sylvatic transmission. Two of the cases were in residents of Brasilia (one fatal case) and 1 case was in Rio de Janeiro. Because the cases were recognized in non-endemic urban areas where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are present, immunization programmes and vector control measures are being carried out in both cities to avoid any potential urban transmission. Adequate supplies of yellow fever vaccine are available in Brazil.", "key_terms": ["fever", "yellow fever"]}
