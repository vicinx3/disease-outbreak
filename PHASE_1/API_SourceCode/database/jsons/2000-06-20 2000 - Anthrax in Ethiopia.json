This area is inhabited by pastoralists who depend on livestock and cases of anthrax are known to occur. Reports from organizations (e.g. United Nations Development Programme, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res) working in the area indicate clusters of cases and increased numbers of cases of a clinical syndrome consistent with anthrax. No systematic epidemiological investigation has been carried out thus far. WHO, in collaboration with MSF/Epicentre and the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia, have planned to carry out an investigation in the region in order to confirm the diagnosis, assess the true extent and impact of the disease and plan and implement control measures.", "key_terms": ["anthrax"]}
