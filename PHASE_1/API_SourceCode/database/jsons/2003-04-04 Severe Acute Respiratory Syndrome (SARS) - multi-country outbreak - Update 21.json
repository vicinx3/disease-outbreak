Of the 26 new patients reported yesterday, two were health care workers, two were residents of Amoy Gardens, and 22 were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia. Health authorities are current investigating sewage samples at a construction site adjacent to Block E apartment building in Amoy Gardens, which has been the source of a large cluster of new SARS cases. New cases have been associated with vertically linked apartments. A second line of investigation is concentrating on a burst sewage pipe in block E that may have epidemiological links with a visitor to Amoy Gardens which was subsequently admitted to Hong Kong\u2019s Prince of Wales Hospital in early March and was said to have been symptomatic at the time of his visit.", "key_terms": ["sars"]}
