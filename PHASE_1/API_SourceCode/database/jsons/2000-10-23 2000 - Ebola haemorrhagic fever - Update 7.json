Reporting and distribution of cases The increase in cases reflects transmission of the disease as it occurred about 8-10 days earlier. As the incubation period is 2 to 21 days, monitoring of the disease for new cases is more accurate when carried out over time rather than day by day. Since Ebola haemorrhagic fever outbreaks usually originate from a single source, cases tend to come in waves: exposure through direct contact, incubation period and then illness. Case finding is continuing in Gulu district. The operational task force is also intensifying its efforts to trace contacts and monitor these people. Adequate supplies in Gulu district The additional 1 370 kg of protective equipment sent by WHO arrived in Gulu district on 23 October. This equipment is adequate to meet the needs of the initial phase of the response.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "illness", "ebola", "ebola haemorrhagic fever"]}
