These two patients had travelled to Libreville for health care. The Ministry of Health is now looking for additional contacts in Libreville. As the maximum incubation period has elapsed since the infected physician left the country and no new cases have been seen, it is unlikely that Ebola virus transmission is still going on in the capital. If no new cases are detected, the physician who left Libreville on 27 October will be the last in the outbreak which then could be declared over on 11 December.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "virus", "ebola"]}
