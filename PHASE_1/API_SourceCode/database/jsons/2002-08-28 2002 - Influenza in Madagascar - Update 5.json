The international team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network continues to work with mobile teams from the Ministry of Health investigating these cases and collecting samples. Since the beginning of August 2002, additional influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been isolated from cases in different provinces. Analysis by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in London, United Kingdom and the Institut Pasteur, Madagascar (National Influenza Centre) have shown that the circulating influenza virus is similar to A(H3N2) viruses\u00a0 (A/Panama/2007/99/(H3N2) ) which have been circulating in the northern and southern hemispheres for several years. The virus circulating in Madagascar is similar to those included in the current influenza vaccine and also in the vaccine for the coming influenza season in the northern hemisphere; these vaccines, therefore, protect against infection with this virus.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "virus"]}
