The death occurred in a previously announced patient, an 18-year-old girl from the northern governorate of Minufiyah. She developed symptoms on 5 April and died on 14 April. The Ministry of Health regards cases as confirmed when positive results are obtained in two laboratories: the country\u2019s national public health laboratory and the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3). Test results on the country\u2019s initial cases have been fully validated by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. All cases confirmed by the Ministry of Health are now listed in the WHO cumulative table of laboratory-confirmed cases. Of the 12 cases in Egypt, four patients have died and one remains hospitalized in stable condition. Seven patients have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital."}
