A team from the WHO Country Office has been present in the affected area since 3 September 2007 with further staff from the WHO Regional Office for Africa joining the field operations on 7 September and this week from WHO Headquarters. The WHO team is working closely with representatives of the Ministry of Health and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res to upgrade the existing facilities. Of high priority is the establishment of a mobile field laboratory to be attached to the existing isolation ward in order to expedite rapid diagnosis of patients and to differentiate between the different pathogens, such as Shigella dysenteriae type 1, that have also been associated with this outbreak. Ongoing surveillance and case finding is also being enhanced and social mobilization activities are under-way to provide the local population with all relevant information in order to contain the outbreak. WHO is also establishing a logistics platform in the vicinity to support the field operations and to facilitate access to the affected area.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "virus", "ebola", "ebola haemorrhagic fever"]}
