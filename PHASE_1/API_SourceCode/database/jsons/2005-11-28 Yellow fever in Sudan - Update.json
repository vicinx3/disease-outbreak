These cases were reported from different localities in South Kordofan State (Abu Jibeha, Abyei, Dilling, Kadugli, Lagawa, Rashad and Talodi). The 1.7 million doses of yellow fever vaccine from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) emergency vaccine stockpile arrived in Sudan this week-end. After two days of training for national teams, a mass vaccination campaign will begin with support from M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (France), MEDAIR, UNICEF and WHO. A Yellow Fever Outbreak Task Force consisting of these organizations working with the Federal Ministry of Health, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Sudanese Red Crescent Society and German Red Cross Society are coordinating the response. WHO has also provided technical support and materials (sprayers and insecticide) for vector control activities. A team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network including a virologist, logistician, entomologist, geographic information specialist and epidemiologists are expected shortly to assist in controlling the outbreak.
