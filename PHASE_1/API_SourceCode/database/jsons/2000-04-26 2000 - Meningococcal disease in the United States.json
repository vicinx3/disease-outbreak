One case is a returning pilgrim with as yet unconfirmed vaccination status, and 1 is a household contact of a returning pilgrim. The third patient did not participate in the Haj and is not known to have close contacts among pilgrims who traveled to Mecca. In the United States, W135 accounts for only 3%-4% of sporadic cases of meningococcal disease. See previous reports of meningococcal disease associated with returnees from the Haj."}
