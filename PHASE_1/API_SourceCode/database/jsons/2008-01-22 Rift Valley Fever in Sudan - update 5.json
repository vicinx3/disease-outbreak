While active surveillance continues in all affected states, no new cases have been reported since 5 January. Only Gazeera state has reported cases with date of onset in 2008, while several additional cases have been reported retrospectively with date of onset in November or December 2007. Several of the newly added cases evidence ocular presentation, which is typically a late-occurring feature of RVF infection.
