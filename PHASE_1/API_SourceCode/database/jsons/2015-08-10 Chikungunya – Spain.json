Spanish health authorities are carrying out epidemiological and entomological investigations as well as establishing vector control measures. National health authorities in France have informed local health authorities, which are implementing vector control activities in the areas visited by the patient. WHO encourages countries to develop and maintain the clinical and laboratory capacity to detect and confirm cases, manage patients and implement social communication strategies to engage the community in reducing the presence of the mosquito vectors.", "key_terms": ["infection", "other", "chikungunya"]}
