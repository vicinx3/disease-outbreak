China now accounts for more probable cases than the rest of the world combined. Beijing reported the highest number of new cases (101) and deaths (9), for a cumulative total of 1440 probable cases and 75 deaths. Of these new cases, 31 were previously reported as suspect cases while 70 were reported for the first time. Nine hospitals in the Chinese capital now deal exclusively with SARS patients.

Health authorities have expressed concern that the SARS outbreak could overwhelm Beijing\u2019s already crowded hospitals. Xiong Ke Chest Hospital will open a new wing with 100 more beds for SARS patients tomorrow, hospital officials told a WHO expert during a visit to the hospital today. With 235 beds all occupied by SARS patients, the hospital already has the largest number of SARS patients in the country. Dr James Maguire, from the WHO team of experts, said that despite extremely difficult working conditions, hospital staff had risen to the occasion. \u201cTheir esprit de corps is excellent. They are taking great pride in what they are doing and working very hard,\u201d he said, adding that some staff work 45 days without seeing their families. The rigorous infection control procedures included heavy and hot protective clothing. Dr Maguire, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said there was a need for more specialized equipment such as masks, gloves, ventilatory equipment, layer protective gear, and ambulances to transport patients between hospitals. WHO staff are aware that other hospitals in the city may need more or better supplies. The disease continued to make its mark elsewhere in the country. Jiangsu Province, which borders Shanghai, reported its first case today.
