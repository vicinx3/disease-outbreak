The provinces of Katanga, Nord-Kivu, Sud-Kivu and Orientale are currently the most affected by cholera outbreaks. The provinces of Kinsasha and Equateur have reported only a few cases. Although the outbreak is in regression in the province of Katanga, the situation in Sud- Kivu, Nord-Kivu and Orientale provinces is still of serious concern. Many activities to prevent further spread and to treat affected populations are being undertaken by the MOH in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, MSF and other NGO's. From 1 April to 18 May, 77 cases of cholera and 3 deaths have been reported in Bujumbura Province, Burundi. The districts of Buyenzi, Bwiza, Cibitoke and Musaga are the most affected. Health education and activities to improve sanitation are being carried out by the MOH. Cases of cholera started to be reported in Rwanda in March in Cyangugu prefecture which is on the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although the number of cases is not very high at present, there is major concern about further spread to other areas of the country. In Uganda, the dramatic cholera outbreak which started in late 1997 is still affecting the country with over 20,000 cases and over 1,000 deaths reported since the beginning of the year. The current cholera outbreak affecting the Great Lakes region confirms earlier forecasts of a potential spread from eastern African countries which were affected by major outbreaks last year to countries in the central and southern part of Africa.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "other", "cholera"]}
