As a result of the reclassification, 18 cases and 6 deaths of EHF have now been reported. Following the latest laboratory results from the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States, 12 of the 30 most recently reported cases (see report ) have now been classified as measles cases. Measles cases have been present in the community and were first reported to the WHO South Sudan Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN) in the second week of March 2004, but the increase in the number of cases was detected because of the active surveillance system established for EHF. Additional laboratory tests are underway. Active surveillance and follow-up of contacts is ongoing.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "measles", "ebola", "ebola haemorrhagic fever"]}
