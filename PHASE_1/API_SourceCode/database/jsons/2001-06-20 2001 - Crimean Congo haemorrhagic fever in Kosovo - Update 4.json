From May 18, 2001 to June 19, 2001, 57 suspected CCHF cases were registered, out of which 4 have died. Of these, 12 have been classified as confirmed (10 laboratory and 2 on clinical/epidemiological grounds). Twenty-seven cases are laboratory negative and 18 further suspected cases were still under investigation. Of the 12 confirmed cases, 5 were infected through contact with 1 case with haemorrhagic disease. The remainder (7) are likely to be primary infections ( Public Health, Pristina, Kosovo). Most of the primary infections have occurred in areas of Kosovo that have had CCHF activity in previous years. CCHF infections are expected to continue throughout the summer and autumn months while ticks are active. The WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research in Ljubljana, Slovenia, continues to provide support in the field by extending the stay of their staff member. In addition the North Manchester General Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases, have provided a clinician with specific expertise in hospital infection control who is working to strengthen procedures at the isolation unit. A two person WHO rapid assessment team carried out a mission to Kosovo from 12 to 15 June 2001. The team worked with the epidemic response committee, the Institute for Public Health, the Clinic for Infectious Diseases and WHO Kosovo to support the outbreak response in epidemiology, laboratory support, case management, hospital infection control, environmental control measures and health education.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "fever", "virus", "epidemic", "infectious"]}
