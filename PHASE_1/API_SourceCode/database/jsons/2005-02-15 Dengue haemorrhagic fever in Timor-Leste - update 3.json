One hundred sixty-six cases of the 215 cases had clinical features compatible with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and the remaining 49 cases were diagnosed as suspected dengue fever (DF) using WHO standard case definitions. Districts reporting DF/DHF cases are Baucau, Dili, Liquica, Maliana and Manatuto with 80% of the cases reported from Dili (see previous report). An entomologist and a virologist from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan, partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, are assisting the Ministry of Health, Timor-Leste. The virologist is supporting the Ministry in laboratory detection of dengue and helping with the collection and identification of the predominant strain in circulation. The entomologist is working with the Ministry and WHO to conduct larval and mosquito surveys to develop a strategy for vector control. WHO and the Ministry of Health have continued to provide practical training seminars on early diagnosis and clinical management of dengue patients for doctors and nurses from the National Hospital, Dili, other hospitals and clinics.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "fever", "infectious", "dengue", "other"]}
