One cluster of 5 cases is associated with St John\u2019s Rehabilitation Hospital in Toronto. The second cluster of 26 cases, including 10 health care workers, is associated with North York General Hospital. One patient undergoing investigation has been linked to both hospitals. As a precaution, both clusters are being managed as possibly representing cases of SARS until proven otherwise. Results of laboratory, clinical and epidemiological investigations are expected early next week. The status of Toronto, which was removed last week from the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission, remains unchanged pending further information made available as the investigations progress.
