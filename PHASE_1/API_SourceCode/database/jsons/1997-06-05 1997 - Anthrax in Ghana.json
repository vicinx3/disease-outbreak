The outbreak was rapidly brought under control. It appears to have been related to butchering of cattle which had died of sudden illness and consumption of meat and other tissues. A total of 185 cases occurred among whom 26 died. Widespread health education in the community about the disease, mode of transmission, risk factors and preventive measures is thought to have been important in the control of the outbreak. Health education continues through radio and mobile vans. The District Veterinary Service has organized mass inoculation of all cattle while slaughter and sale of cattle in the area is temporarily banned.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "illness", "anthrax", "other"]}
