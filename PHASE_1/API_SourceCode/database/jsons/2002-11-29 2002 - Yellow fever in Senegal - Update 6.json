WHO is supporting these immunization campaigns with both technical assistance and vaccine supplies. As reported previously, laboratory testing suggests that one case (onset of symptoms was 9 November) has occurred in Dakar, but a thorough epidemiological investigation of this case and active surveillance in Dakar have not detected additional cases. A plan for intensified social mobilization has been formulated by the Ministry of Health with WHO technical assistance. Financial support is being provided by WHO and the local office of the Children's Vaccine Program at PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health). Several local partners, including CVP, UNICEF and WHO, will support implementation.
