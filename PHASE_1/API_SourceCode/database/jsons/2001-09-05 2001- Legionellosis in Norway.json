All the patients had visited a limited area of the centre of Stavanger within ten days of the onset of symptoms. Local health authorities in collaboration with NIPH have identified several possible sources of legionellosis within this area, including a water fountain situated in a park and several cooling towers. Results from samples taken from these possible sources are pending. The fountain in question has been closed down and all cooling towers in the vicinity have been disinfected.
