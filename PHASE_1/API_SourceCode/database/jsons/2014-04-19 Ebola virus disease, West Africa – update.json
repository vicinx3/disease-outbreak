The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guinea convened a meeting with a number of diplomatic missions on 18 April where the Minister of Health, supported by the WHO Representative, WHO Country Office for Guinea, and WHO EVD Response Coordinator, briefed the meeting. WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are in the process of deploying additional experts to support activities in case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing, social mobilization and psychosocial support. Numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations. In Liberia, the epidemiological situation remains the same. Intensive surveillance activities and other preventive measures are ongoing. No new laboratory confirmed cases of EVD have been reported from Liberia today. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.
