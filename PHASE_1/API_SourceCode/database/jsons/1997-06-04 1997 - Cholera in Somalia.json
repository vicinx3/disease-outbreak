The cumulative number of cases reported is now 5557 with 247 deaths (CFR 4.4%), but the real number of cases is believed to be higher, since mild cases are excluded in the reports from most treatment centres, and in some areas laboratory confirmation has not been possible due to logistical constraints and security problems. Suspected cholera outbreaks in areas of Middle Shabelle and Galgaduud Regions have been reported recently. The epidemic in Mogadishu declined steadily up to mid-May but rose again the following week and it is impossible to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in this region at present. WHO continued its support to NGOs and local authorities, supplying ORS, Ringers Lactate and antibiotics. Water chlorination and health education continue in local communities with support from UNICEF, Intensified efforts are still necessary to guarantee sufficient supplies to all NGOs involved and to facilitate laboratory confirmation. Continued vigilance is needed, especially in areas not yet affected by this epidemic.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "cholera"]}
