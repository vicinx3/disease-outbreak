In the first four weeks of 1998 a total of 2 863 cases with 16 deaths had been reported compared with only 174 cases with 1 death in the corresponding period of 1997. The largest numbers of cases were reported in the following departments:- Arequipa, Lima, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Ancash and Cuzco but cases have occurred in many other departments including those in the forest areas where no cases or very few had previously been reported. This large increase has probably occurred as a result of storms and floods caused by El Ni\u2013o. The national authorities are discussing with WHO the necessity of stepping up and reactivating cholera control activities and neighbouring countries have been informed of the situation.", "key_terms": ["other", "cholera"]}
