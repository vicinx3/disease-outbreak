The family cluster has been under investigationas the first possible instance of limited human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 avian influenza strain. Virus genetic materials from two fatal cases in this cluster \u2013 sisters aged 23 and 30 years \u2013 have now been fully sequenced by the Government Virus Unit of Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Health. Both viruses are of avian origin and contain no human influenza genes. This finding, which indicates that the virus has not changed to a form easily transmitted from one person to another, is consistent with earlier findings from epidemiological investigations. No illness has been reported in other family members, in the local community, or in health workers involved in care of these patients. China (poultry) Chinese authorities have today confirmed H5N1 infection in poultry in an additional province. The H5N1 strain was detected in samples from infected chickens at two farms in the southern province of Jiangxi. Altogether, H5N1 infection in poultry is confirmed or suspected at farms in 13 of China\u2019s 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. No cases of human H5N1 infection have been reported in China to date.", "key_terms": ["infection", "virus", "illness", "other"]}
