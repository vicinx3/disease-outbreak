Monkeypox is a rare viral disease with a clinical presentation similar to smallpox. It is largely limited to populations who come into contact with animals which harbour the monkeypox virus in remote areas of the tropical rainforest in Africa. As mentioned in the article in Weekly Epidemiological Record No.15 published 11 April 1997, the current measures undertaken to interrupt disease transmission include education of health-care providers and distribution of health messages, such as limiting contact with wild-caught animals and restricting contact with suspected cases to a single person (preferably the oldest member of the household who has either recovered from monkeypox or has a \"vaccinia\" vaccination scar). Further WHO studies are planned in the region to determine the need for additional risk-reduction measures.", "key_terms": ["virus", "smallpox", "pox", "vaccinia", "monkeypox"]}
