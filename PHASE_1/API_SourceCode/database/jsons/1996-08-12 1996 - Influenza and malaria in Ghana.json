The press release informs that most cases are malaria and acute upper respiratory tract infection of viral origin according to preliminary investigations. The viral infection usually lasts for a few days and is usually not associated with serious illness. Most cases need only palliative treatment for pain and cough. Antibiotics are not required. Cases of malaria are not uncommon during this time of the year when the rains, heat and humidity provide the ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes. Most cases respond favourably to chloroquine treatment when administered properly.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "illness", "malaria"]}
