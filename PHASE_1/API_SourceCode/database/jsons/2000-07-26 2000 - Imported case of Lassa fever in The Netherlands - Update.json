He was initially treated for malaria in Sierra Leone on 11 July, and then traveled to The Netherlands (arrived 14 July) to visit relatives. He was admitted to the hospital on 15 July. Lassa fever was suspected when his condition worsened on 20 July and treatment with ribavirin was started. On 22 July, the Bernard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany reported that Lassa virus was detected in a blood sample sent for diagnostic testing. While the risk of infection for those who traveled with this person from Freetown to Amsterdam is minimal, potential contacts are being traced and monitored in both The Netherlands as well as in Africa. As mentioned in the 25 July posting, this is the fourth case of Lassa fever imported into Europe this year: see previous reports, 4 April, 14 March, 13 March, 18 January and 13 January.\u00a0 All four patients have died although the death of one case was not the direct result of the acute infection.", "key_terms": ["infection", "fever", "virus", "lassa fever", "malaria"]}
