The four cases belonged to the same family of herders living in close contact with their sheep. Specimens were collected from the two surviving patients, from other members of the family who developed fever without haemorrhagic symptoms and from many of the contacts. Blood specimens from cases and contacts were shipped to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Special Pathogens at the Centre for Applied Medical Research, Public Health Laboratory Service, Porton Down, United Kingdom for testing. All had IgG and IgM antibody to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus indicating recent infection. Other virologic testing is in progress at Porton Down.", "key_terms": ["infection", "fever", "virus", "other"]}
