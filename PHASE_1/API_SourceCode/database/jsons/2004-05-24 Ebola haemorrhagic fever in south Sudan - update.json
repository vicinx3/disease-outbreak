Laboratory testing performed by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) United States have confirmed EHF. WHO South Sudan Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN) along with a team from WHO headquarters have been working closely with the health authorities and partners in Yambio County helping with the creation of a Crisis Committee to control the outbreak. This committee includes UNICEF, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res-France and other nongovernmental organizations and churches working in public health. The committee is working actively in social mobilization, supporting case management in Yambio hospital, and organizing the follow-up of contacts of people who have been ill with the disease. Currently, the outbreak appears to be restricted to the environs of Yambio; however, neighbouring countries have been notified. At this stage, WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade as a result of this outbreak.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "ebola", "other", "ebola haemorrhagic fever"]}
