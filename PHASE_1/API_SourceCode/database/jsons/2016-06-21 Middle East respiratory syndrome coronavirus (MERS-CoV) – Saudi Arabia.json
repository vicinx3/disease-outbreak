A MERS-CoV outbreak is currently ongoing in a hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh region. The index case for this outbreak is the 49 year-old female reported to WHO on 15 June (see DON posted 19 June, case no.1). The case has co-morbidities. On 10 June she was admitted to the hospital with unrelated symptoms. She was triaged in the Emergency Department for her illness. She was then admitted to the vascular surgery ward \u2013 MERS-CoV infection was not considered. She was not isolated and was managed in a multi-bed room. During this time, more than 49 HCWs and patients were exposed. After she was confirmed as a MERS-CoV case, a Rapid Response Team was dispatched and extensive contract tracing was initiated. Twenty (20) of those screened so far at the hospital and in the household have tested positive for MERS-CoV. These are seventeen (17) healthcare contacts and three (3) household contacts. Eighteen (18) of the twenty (20) are asymptomatic. The vascular surgery ward was closed and elective procedure were reschedules. The necessary control measures are being put in place.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,761 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 629 related deaths. MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "virus", "illness", "mers", "other", "mers-cov"]}
