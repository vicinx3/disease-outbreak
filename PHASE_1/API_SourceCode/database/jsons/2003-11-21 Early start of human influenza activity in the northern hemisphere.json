In Canada, more than a half of the A(H3N2) isolates characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, while the rest were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the US, more than \u00be of the A(H3N2) isolates were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the last eight weeks, five deaths in children, two in England and three in Scotland, have been confirmed as due to A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus. A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains are drift variants of the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine virus. Therefore antibodies produced against the A/Panama/2007/99-like strain(see WER 2003 78(9): 58-62 and WER 2003 87(11):77 ) do cross-react with A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, but at a lower level. For example, in laboratory tests of sera from recipients of influenza vaccines currently used in the northern hemisphere, there were on average 41% reductions in the post-immunization antibody titres to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, when compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain. However despite such reductions, the tests demonstrated that 76% of adult and 72% of the elderly vaccinees possessed protective levels of antibody(HI titres of >40) to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains.
