As of 25 April 2002, 95 463 cases, including 571 dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases and 31 deaths, were reported within Rio de Janeiro Municipality alone. A dramatic decrease in disease activity was observed during the month of April in the Municipality, with cases occurring between 1 and 25 April representing 3% of cases reported since the beginning of the year. This outbreak is associated with dengue serotype 3, which has only been recently introduced in the population and explains the increased number of DHF cases registered in 2002.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "dengue"]}
