The patient, a 72 year old male, had attended the October 2001 World Championship of Model Airplane Flying near Bakersfield, California, United States (US) from 4-14 October. The World Championship was an international event with competing teams from 30 countries. Also in attendance were team supporters and spectators from around the world. \u00a0 WHO has received additional reports of possible cases of coccidioidomycosis, however these cases have not been officially confirmed. WHO Regional Offices have been notified and a contact list of participants and attendees of the event has been sent to them. WHO is monitoring the situation closely. Coccidioidomycosis is caused by Coccidioides immitits, occurs in arid and semi-arid regions and is endemic in the south-western US. The disease is acquired by inhalation of the infective organism from soil or laboratory cultures. It is not directly transmissible from humans or from animals to humans. After an incubation period of 1-4 weeks, the primary infection may be entirely asymptomatic or resemble an acute influenzal illness. Disseminated disease may develop insidiously, sometimes years after the primary infection. Effective treatment is available.
