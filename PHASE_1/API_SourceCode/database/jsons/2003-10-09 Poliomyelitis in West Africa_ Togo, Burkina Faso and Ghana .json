This case, as well as cases reported in 2003 from Burkina Faso and Ghana, were found to be due to wild poliovirus type 1 that is genetically related to a lineage of wild poliovirus circulating in northern Nigeria and southern Niger. To date in 2003, 1 case of poliomyelitis following importation of wild poliovirus has been reported in Togo, 1 case in Burkina Faso, and 6 cases in Ghana. For Burkina Faso, Ghana and Togo, the appearance of cases in 2003 follow long periods without isolation of wild poliovirus, in the presence of high-quality surveillance. Burkina Faso has been polio-free since 2001 with the exception of one case following importation of wild poliovirus in 2002. Ghana has been polio-free since 2001. Togo has been polio-free since 2000. Given the close proximity to Nigeria, one of the three main poliovirus reservoirs in the world, the ongoing risk of importations remains high.
