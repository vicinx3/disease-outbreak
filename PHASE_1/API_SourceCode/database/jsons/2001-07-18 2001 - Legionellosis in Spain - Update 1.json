Three-hundred-ten of these cases have been laboratory confirmed. The first case was hospitalized on 1 July. Two deaths (one confirmed case and one suspected case) have been reported. No cases have been reported among tourists. Since 7 July, incidence has declined rapidly and there have been no new cases reported since 14 July. The epidemiological investigation and surveillance are continuing. The most likely source of the outbreak is a cooling tower in the city centre. The cooling tower has now been disinfected. Additional information received after this posting indicates that several cooling towers in the area were positive for Legionella by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the organism has not been isolated thus far. Control measures have focused on all cooling towers which may be involved, as well as other potential sources.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "other"]}
