Laboratory testing has confirmed the disease in humans and animals in 4 governorates: Hodeidah, Hajjah, Mahweet and Sadeh and there is serologic evidence of the disease in animals in Dhamar governorate. \u00a0 Surveillance and control activities are ongoing.\u00a0 Although the disease is restricted to the north-western part of the country, areas to the southwest are now experiencing evidence of Rift Valley fever transmission. There is persistent transmission in El-Zuhrah district, Hodeidah governorate despite extensive and vigorous mosquito control activities. A team of epidemiologists will be carrying out a survey in El-Zuhrah district to assess the importance of direct animal contact versus exposure to mosquitoes as a risk factor for disease.\u00a0 It will also assess the economic impact of the outbreak on the community. A joint technical team has been formed by the Ministries of Health and Agriculture of the governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia to fight the epidemic. WHO has launched an appeal for US$ 975 000 to support efforts to control and prevent Rift Valley Fever\u00a0 in Yemen (see previous report).", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "epidemic", "rift valley fever"]}
