The case-fatality rate of 1.1% is lower this year than in previous years. Although all 30 provinces have been affected, outbreaks with unusually high numbers of cases have been reported from 293 cities and districts in 17 provinces of the country. During the 1998 pandemic, in which more than 1.2 million cases of dengue fever and DHF were reported to WHO from 56 countries, Indonesia reported an annual number of 72,133 cases and 1414 deaths with overall case fatality rate of 2.0%. The outbreak in Indonesia this year appears to be of similar magnitude. As in 1998, Dengue 3 appears to be the predominant circulating virus serotype (37%) in Indonesia this year, but Den-4 (19%) Den-2 and Den-1 are also present. At the end of April the situation has returned to normal with all provinces reporting cases at a low level. Jakarta, Bali and Nusa Tenggarah Timur, which were among the most affected provinces, are still being monitored closely.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "virus", "dengue"]}
