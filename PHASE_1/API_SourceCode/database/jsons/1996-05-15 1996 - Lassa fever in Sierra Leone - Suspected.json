The rapid assessment identified 76 suspected cases with 46 deaths from 1 January to 10 May in the Kenema Districts (mainly Tongo, Panguma and Segbwema), Eastern Region. Most cases were in adolescent females. Almost all who were pregnant aborted and most of these women died. The outbreak occurred in an area where Lassa fever is endemic and coincided with an unprecedented increase in the rat population in the affected towns. A special task force has been established for control activities. As the hospitals in Kenema lack capacity for safe barrier nursing an isolation ward with 24 beds has been made available for patient management at the Government Hospital. Blood specimens collected by the investigating team will be shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA for investigation.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "lassa fever", "other"]}
