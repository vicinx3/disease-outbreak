According to the initial laboratory analysis in Basra, cholera is highly probable. Further laboratory confirmation with serotyping is awaited. WHO staff in the field have already set up a surveillance system. They are currently conducting a survey of diarrhoeal cases in other hospitals, and have established an outbreak committee that is implementing control measures using pre-positioned supplies. Due to the current security situation and difficulties experienced in restoring safe water supplies to the population, a larger cholera epidemic is predicted.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "other", "cholera"]}
