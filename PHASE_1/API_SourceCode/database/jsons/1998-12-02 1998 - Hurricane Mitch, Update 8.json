Leptospirosis epidemic activity in Nicaragua. Low activity in Honduras and Guatemala. El Salvador and Belize did not report presence of cases in post-Mitch period. Dengue epidemic activity in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Honduras and Nicaragua reported the presence of hemorrhagic dengue.
