Investigations by the Ministry of Health with the collaboration of WHO are in progress and preventive and control measures are being implemented. Rising water levels have caused breakdowns in the water-supply system, resulting in a significant risk of contamination. Local authorities, with the help of NGOs, have already evacuated around 20\u00a0000 people. The current level of flooding is affecting an area inhabited by 2 million people, and it is feared that the peak level has not yet been reached. The total population of Kinshasa is 7 million. A crisis committee has been set up by the Minister of Health in which UN agencies, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations are participating. They are currently visiting the affected sites. An international response is being organized and some countries and agencies have already mobilized funds for the provision of food and other supplies.", "key_terms": ["other", "cholera"]}
