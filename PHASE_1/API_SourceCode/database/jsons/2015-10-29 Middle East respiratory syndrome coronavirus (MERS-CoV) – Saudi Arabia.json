A 65-year-old male from Aldawadmi city developed symptoms on 11 October and, on 16 October, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 17 October. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. A 29-year-old, non-national female from Riyadh city was identified through contact tracing. She developed symptoms on 13 October and, on 14 October, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 17 October. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient lives in a housing compound that has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak; furthermore, she has a history of contact with a MERS-CoV case (see DON published on 22 October \u2013 case no. 4). The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to being detected. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,611 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 575 related deaths. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "virus", "mers", "other", "mers-cov"]}
