This secondary case was an employee of the funeral home tasked with handling the primary case\u2019s corpse on 2 March (see DON posted 23 March). The case had recovered by 6 April, when all the contacts completed their 21-day follow-up period, however his hospital discharge was delayed due to persistent viraemia. The patient was discharged after two consecutive negative test results by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Tests were performed on blood, urine, and pharyngeal swab samples at 24-hour intervals. Based on the current information, there is no further risk of secondary transmission of Lassa fever in Germany. Lassa fever cases have been reported among travellers returning from West Africa. The risk of disease spread to non-endemic countries by travellers from Lassa fever endemic countries in the West Africa is very low. WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Germany based on the information available.", "key_terms": ["fever", "lassa fever"]}
