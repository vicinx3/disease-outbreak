WHO and its partners continue to provide the necessary technical expertise to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. This includes, among others, a high-level advocacy meeting with the governments of the three affected countries to enhance coordination, information management, and communication. The WHO Regional Director, in consultation with the Director General, has established a temporary function of WHO sub-regional EVD outbreak response Coordinator to directly support the affected countries. The Coordinator will be based in Conakry, Guinea. In addition, WHO is planning a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub-region to be held 2\u20133 July in Accra, Ghana, with the objective of ensuring increased political commitment and cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO, GOARN, and other partners are also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in deploying additional experts in the various specialities (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, data management, and logistics, among others) to support the EVD outbreak response efforts. The next cross-border technical meeting among the three countries is planned for 23 June 2014 in Kailahun, Sierra Leone. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.
