Because of persisting communications problems with health personnel in the field, comprehensive surveillance data for the affected areas has been difficult to obtain. However, WHO reported the preliminary results of a retrospective survey conducted by Epicentre and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF-France) in Bosobolo covering approximately 300 households. A total of \u00a01 245 cases including 18 deaths (case-fatality rate 1.4%) was recorded. The attack rate was 47%. The outbreak in the surveyed area peaked by early November . All age groups have been affected with the highest case fatality rate over 3% observed in children under 5 years of age and the elderly. Preliminary results of blood samples tested at Institut Pasteur (Paris) indicate recent infection compatible with the current circulating influenza virus (H3N2). \u00a0Further testing to characterize the virus is necessary. WHO, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF- Belgium ), MEMISA, and FOMETRO are supporting the Ministry of Health in laboratory diagnosis and provision of supplies.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "virus"]}
