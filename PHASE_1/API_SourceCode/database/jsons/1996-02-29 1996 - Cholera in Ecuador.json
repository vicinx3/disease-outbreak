A total of 416 cases with 4 deaths were reported between 1 and 31 January. The majority of these cases (71%) occurred in the Otovalo indigenous community. Due to the difficulty in access to health services of the population in this area special measures have been undertaken by the Ministry of Health to ensure greater distribution of oral rehydration salts and control of the outbreak. A group of national experts together with a WHO/Pan American Health Organization epidemiologist are coordinating these efforts.
