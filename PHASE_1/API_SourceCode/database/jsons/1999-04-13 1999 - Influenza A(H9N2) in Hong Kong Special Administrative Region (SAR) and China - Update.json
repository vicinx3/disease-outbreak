Studies on the spread of A(H9N2) viruses between cages of chickens indicate that quail H9N2 virus is transmitted by aerosol more effectively than by faecal transmission. In China, 5 human cases of influenza A(H9N2) were apparently identified in March 1999, but laboratory confirmation of the virus was not reported. Of the 5 cases, the youngest was 1 year old and the oldest was a man in his 70s. All patients apparently had mild influenza-like symptoms and recovered with no medical complications.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "virus"]}
