Of the latest laboratory-confirmed cases, one is from Beijing, one from Shanghai, two from Jiangsu and two from Zhejiang. The first patient reported from Beijing is a seven-year-old girl who became ill on 11 April 2013. The patient from Shanghai is a 56-year-old man who became ill on 1 April 2013. The two patients from Jiangsu are a 77-year-old woman who became ill on 5 April 2013, and a 72-year-old man who became ill on 1 April 2013. The two patients from Zhejiang are a 65-year-old man who became ill on 3 April 2013 and a 38-year-old man who became ill on 6 April 2013. To date, a total of 49 patients have been laboratory-confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China; including 11 deaths. More than a thousand close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China. So far, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied. 1. WHO is currently publishing information on laboratory confirmed cases received through the official notification from the Chinese National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point once a day. This formal notification and publication follows verification of the information, and may therefore come after, or not include, some cases reported through public media and other sources. 2. To date, there is limited information to determine whether the reported number of cases represents some or all of the cases actually occurring. As some relatively mild cases of illness have now been reported, it is possible that there are other such cases that have not been identified and reported. 3. If the current pattern of sporadic infections continues, WHO will cease frequent reporting of case numbers, and focus its Disease Outbreak News on new developments or changes in the pattern or presentation of infections.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "virus", "illness", "other"]}
