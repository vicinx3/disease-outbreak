So far, five districts primarily in the region of Logone Occidental experience an epidemic (Benoye, Kello, Laokassy, Melfi and Moundou ) while two others are in alert (Boussou and Sarh). The predominance of Neisseria meningitidis A in epidemic districts has been laboratory-confirmed by latex agglutination test, with no other Neisseria meningitidis serogroup being identified in these areas. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has provided 752,000 doses of bivalent polysaccharide AC vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign in affected areas of Benoye, Kello, Laokassy, Melfi and Moundou. Vaccines are being provided with the support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res. WHO, UNICEF, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res and the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) are working with the Ministry of Health, Chad, to implement the vaccination campaigns as well as other emergency control measures, including case management and enhanced surveillance in neighbouring districts.", "key_terms": ["epidemic", "other"]}
