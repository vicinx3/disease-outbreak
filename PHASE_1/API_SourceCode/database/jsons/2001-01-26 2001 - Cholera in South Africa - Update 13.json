The outbreak in Kwazulu-Natal is primarily affecting the Empangeni area, made up of the Lower Umfolozi districts and the Eshowe/Nkandla area. The lower South Coast is affected mainly in the KwaDukuza/Stanger area and Ugu Region/South Coast. Cholera is endemic to the eastern seaboard of southern Africa and outbreaks can occur sporadically in any part of the world where water supplies, sanitation, food safety and hygiene practices are inadequate. An overall management strategy is being implemented to include treatment of patients, provision of clean water and sanitation as well as education and information about how to live in a cholera area.\u00a0 The Department of Health will also work with the Department of Education to bring this information into schools.\u00a0 No special restrictions on travel to and from KwaZulu-Natal are warranted.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "cholera"]}
