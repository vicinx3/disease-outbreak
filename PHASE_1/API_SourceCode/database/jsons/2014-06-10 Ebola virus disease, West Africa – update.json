This brings the total number of EVD clinical cases to 89 (33 confirmed, 3 probable, and 53 suspected) including 7 deaths. All 33 confirmed cases and 7 deaths were reported from Kailahun district. The number of cases among health-care workers is 5 and deaths is 1. There are currently 11 cases in isolation at Kenema Hospital. The number of contacts currently being followed-up is 30. Community resistance is hindering the identification and follow-up of contacts. Overall, the total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data and enhanced surveillance. WHO and partners continue to support the implementation of preventive and control measures in the affected countries. In Sierra Leone, WHO is training health-care workers on case and data management and in reviewing messages for social mobilization. Currently, there is only 1 isolation facility located at Kenema. WHO and partners are establishing two Isolation sites in Darra and Koindu. Clinicians and infection prevention and control experts will be deployed to manage the new isolation sites. Four proposals which were developed with support from WHO have received funding from CERF, OCHA Emergency Fund, DFID, and the African Development Bank (ADB). Guinea and Liberia have also received funding from ADB. In Guinea, the joint WHO/HQ and AFRO mission continues to provide support on reviewing the outbreak response operations. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.
