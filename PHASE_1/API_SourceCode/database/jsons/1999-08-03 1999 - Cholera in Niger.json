Control measures which were taken at the early stages of the outbreak have helped to decrease the numbers of cases and since 28 July only 1 or 2 cases are occurring daily. The Minister of Public Health visited the area to make the public aware of the situation and to encourage the field teams for their work. Various materials and medicines were supplied by UNICEF, WHO and \"Italian Cooperation\" both in the districts affected and in other regions in case of spread.
