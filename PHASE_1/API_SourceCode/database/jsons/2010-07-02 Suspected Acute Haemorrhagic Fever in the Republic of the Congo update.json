Additional laboratory investigations are ongoing. The tests were carried out by the Centre International de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon. Samples from the other three suspected fatal cases could not be obtained . The negative laboratory findings from this suspected case do not exclude that an acute haemorrhagic fever outbreak has occurred, or is still ongoing. The Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners continue to strengthen surveillance activities in humans and the wild life sector, and to implement control measures including active case search, infection control, and social mobilization. More than 40 people who have had direct contact with the suspected cases will continue to be monitored for a period of 21 days from the last date of their exposure (19 June).", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "fever", "virus", "ebola", "marburg", "other"]}
