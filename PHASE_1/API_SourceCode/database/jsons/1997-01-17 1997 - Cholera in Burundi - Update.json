The breakdown of water supplies after the affected village was the target of an armed group, continuing poor hygiene practices and an increase in the number of displaced persons in the area have all contributed to this outbreak. A national cholera control committee has been established with the support of WHO and other agencies. A plan of action which puts emphasis on improved case management, surveillance and prevention of the spread of the disease has been prepared together with a request by the government to WHO for acute basic needs.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "other", "cholera"]}
