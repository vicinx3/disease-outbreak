The areas of Padak, Mading, Wanding, Lankien, Akobo and Burmat have reported\u00a0 a total of 892 cases with 24 death up to 27 April 1999. These figures are cases admitted to hospital and are provisional. The epidemic mainly affects the Jonglei region in areas south of the river Sobat. As it is the beginning of the rainy season people have started moving with their animals from locations along the river to inland sites where other areas are likely to be affected. A response team coordinated by UNICEF is meeting twice weekly to review the situation, share information and plan the response strategy. UNICEF currently has ORS and tetracycline on standby for use as the need arises. WHO has sent an epidemiologist to assist local health authorities to assess the situation in the affected areas.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "other"]}
