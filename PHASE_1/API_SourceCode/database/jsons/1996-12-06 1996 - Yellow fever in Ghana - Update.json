A vaccination campaign has been initiated in the areas affected and the Ministry of Health has requested WHO experts to assist in assessing the extent of the outbreak and to advise on control measures. A total of 90 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine was required immediately for coverage of the affected villages and WHO has already supplied 30 000 doses. However, a further 1.4 million doses of vaccine as well as syringes and needles would be required to cover the estimated at-risk population. Children of 1-15 years of age would be targeted in the Upper East Region which would amount to 600 000. In the Northern Region which borders the Upper East Region, the target population would be children aged 1-10 years and would amount to 800 000. Laboratory supplies would also be needed.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "yellow fever"]}
