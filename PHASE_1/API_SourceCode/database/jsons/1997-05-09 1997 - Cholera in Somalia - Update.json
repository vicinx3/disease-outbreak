Weekly reports have been made by NGOs working in the country as well as by the local authorities where available. A total of over 2 000 cases with 74 deaths has been recorded in the epidemic in Mogadishu but it appears that it has now passed its peak, although high levels are still being reported. Intensified efforts are still necessary to guarantee sufficient supplies to all NGOs involved and continued vigilance is needed, especially in those areas not yet affected by this epidemic. WHO is supporting the NGO's and local authorities by providing technical support and supplies.", "key_terms": ["epidemic", "cholera"]}
