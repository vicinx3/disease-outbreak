All these cases have been in Cyangugu prefecture, but there is great concern about further spread to other areas of the country. WHO is providing cholera kits to Kigali, Rwanda and with other international organizations is working closely with the Ministry of Health on prevention and control measures. Cholera has also badly affected the eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although exact figures are not available, the situation in the Shabunda area of Sud-Kivu remains grave. The current deteriorating security situation in the area has affected control activities and the transport of supplies to treatment centres. The Great Lakes Region was ravaged by a dramatic cholera epidemic in 1994-1995 during the massive displacement of refugees provoked by the civil war in Rwanda.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "other", "cholera"]}
