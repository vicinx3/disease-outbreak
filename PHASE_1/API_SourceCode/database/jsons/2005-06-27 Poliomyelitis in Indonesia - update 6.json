The cases are from Western Java and Banten provinces. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 31 May, just before the immunization 'mop-up' campaign held on 31 May to 2 June. This campaign covered West Java, Banten and Jakarta provinces, to reach 6.4 million children under the age of five years. Planning is under way for the second round campaign (to be held on 28-29 June) for the same provinces. One case was reported on 22 June from Demak district in Central Java, a hitherto unaffected province and outside the area where the 'mop-up' campaign was held. A large outbreak response immunization targeting 76,000 children aged less than five years is being implemented around the case in Central Java. The province will be included in the next phase of the large-scale immunization campaigns which will start from August.", "key_terms": ["outbreak"]}
