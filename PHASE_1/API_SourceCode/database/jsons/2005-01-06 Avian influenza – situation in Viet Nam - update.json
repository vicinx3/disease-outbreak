Both patients have died. Initial tests have identified the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus. Further testing is under way. The first patient was a 6-year-old boy from the southern province of Dong Thap. He died on 30 December. The second patient was a 9-year-old boy from Tra Vinh Province, also located in the southern part of the country. He was hospitalized on 2 January and died on 4 January. The additional recent case in Viet Nam, reported in late December, remains hospitalized in critical condition. All three of these most recent cases have occurred in the southern part of the country, where poultry outbreaks have been recurring since December of last year. Close contacts of these cases are being monitored for any signs of illness. Health authorities in Viet Nam, supported by WHO staff, have undertaken several measures to strengthen case detection. Avian influenza viruses become more active when temperatures turn cooler. Activities associated with the approach of the Lunar New Year festivities in early February may also increase the risk of further human cases.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "infection", "virus", "illness"]}
