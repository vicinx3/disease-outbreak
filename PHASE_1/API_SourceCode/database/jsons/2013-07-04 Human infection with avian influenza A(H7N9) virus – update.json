The patient is a 15-year-old boy reported from Jiangsu who became ill on 25 April 2013 and hospitalized on 26 April 2013. He recovered and was discharged on 2 May 2013. The results of molecular diagnostics were positive for H3N2 seasonal influenza virus and H7N9 avian influenza virus. On 1 July, Jiangsu Provincial Health Department consulted national and provincial experts for diagnosis. To date, WHO has been informed of a total of 133 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 43 deaths. Authorities in affected locations continue to maintain surveillance, epidemiological investigations, close contact tracing, clinical management, laboratory testing and sharing of samples as well as prevention and control measures. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. WHO continues to work with Member States and international partners to monitor the situation. WHO will provide updates as the situation evolves.", "key_terms": ["infection", "virus"]}
