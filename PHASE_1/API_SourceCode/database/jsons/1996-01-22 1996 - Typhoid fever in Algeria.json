By 10 January, 910 suspected cases had been reported, over 80% of them have been confirmed. Laboratory confirmation was requested in case of unclear clinical diagnosis. One suspected case died at home. The epidemic has declined - from 92 new cases per day at the peak to about 20 new cases per day around 10 January - and is now fully under control. The village has adequate primary health care service backed up by the infectious disease hospital El-Kettar in Alger. Two local and one central multisectoral crisis centres have been established to control the epidemic. The outbreak was caused by sewage water contaminating the water reservoirs after a sewage pipe had been damaged during construction work.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "fever", "epidemic", "infectious"]}
