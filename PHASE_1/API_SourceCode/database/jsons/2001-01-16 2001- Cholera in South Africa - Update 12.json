The lower South Coast is affected mainly in the KwaDukuza/Stanger area and Ugu Region/South Coast. The WHO team of epidemiologists from the WHO Regional Office for Africa, working with the Department of Health has made a number of recommendations to assess control measures taken so far and to plan further activities to limit the spread of the outbreak. Intersectoral coordination will be increased and the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Water Affairs and Forestry is developing a strategy to address water and sanitation needs.\u00a0 The health sector is to continue close monitoring, training and supervision through the deployment of staff from other provinces and the employment of temporary health promotion workers in affected areas.\u00a0 The WHO team noted the strong commitment of health personnel in the affected areas and their effective case management of patients which is reflected in the low fatality rate of less than 0.5%. Health preparedness amongst people in unaffected areas that have high potential for cholera outbreaks will be increased with enhanced mass media information campaigns, targeting schools. No special restrictions on travel to and from KwaZulu-Natal are warranted.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "other", "cholera"]}
