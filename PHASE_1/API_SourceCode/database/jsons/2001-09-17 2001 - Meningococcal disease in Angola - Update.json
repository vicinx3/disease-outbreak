Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A was laboratory confirmed for this outbreak and a mass vaccination campaign was launched in the affected district. To date, the Benguela Province has reported 94 cases and 14 deaths. Recently other provinces in Angola (Cunene: 44 cases, 7 deaths; Cuando Cubango: 25 cases, 0 deaths) have reported meningococcal disease to WHO. However, the data from the newly affected provinces does not allow the determination of whether any districts in these provinces have exceeded the epidemic threshold. Angola has reported a total of 193 cases and 24 deaths of meningococcal disease so far this year.", "key_terms": ["outbreak", "epidemic", "other"]}
