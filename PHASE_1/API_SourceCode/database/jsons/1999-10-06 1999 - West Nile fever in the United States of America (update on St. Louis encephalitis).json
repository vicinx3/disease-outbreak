Following the finding of West Nile-like virus in this area, all human cases previously reported as SLE were retested. To date, 50 previously reported SLE cases have been confirmed as West Nile fever. Of these, 38 were among residents of New York City, while the others occurred in surrounding areas. There have been 5 deaths among older adults.
