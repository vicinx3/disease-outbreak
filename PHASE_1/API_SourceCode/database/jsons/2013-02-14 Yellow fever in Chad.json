The two cases from Goz Beida and Guereda districts, were laboratory confirmation by a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal. They were identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever, following intensive surveillance which was triggered in response to the outbreak of yellow fever in neighbouring Sudan\u2019s Darfur region. The intensive surveillance in Chad also reported 139 suspected cases and 9 deaths. The vaccination campaign will be conducted in 3 districts bordering Darfur, Sudan, namely Goz Beida, Guereda and Adr\u00e9, targeting over a million people, including inhabitants of refugee camps in the area. The campaign is supported by the Chad\u2019s Ministry of Health, the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG11), and GAVI Alliance. 1 The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund.
