A 46-year-old, non-national female from the Eastern region was identified through contact screening as she is a family member of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case reported in a previous DON on 16 June. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 18 June. She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, she is still asymptomatic in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. An 11-year-old, non-national male from the Eastern region was identified through contact screening as he is a family member of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case reported in a previous DON on 16 June. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 18 June. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. The National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates also notified WHO of the death of the MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 16 June. Globally, WHO has been notified of 1,350 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 480 related deaths. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "key_terms": ["infection", "virus", "mers", "other", "mers-cov"]}
