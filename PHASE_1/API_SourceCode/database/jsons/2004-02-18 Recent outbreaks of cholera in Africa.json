As of 10 February 2004, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of 236 cases including 6 deaths in the provinces of Bubamza, Bujumbura, Bururi and Citiboke. A WHO team is investigating the outbreak. As cholera transmission in the outbreak is closely linked to the lack of a safe water supply, a specific intervention for the chlorination of drinking water has been implemented. Cameroon The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in Cameroon centred around Douala with 514 cases and 13 deaths (case fatality rate, 2.5%).
