Supect cases have been reported from Margibi, Monserado and Grand Gedeh Counties. The immunization campaign is continuing in all these areas as well as in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County. Information posted on 19 December 1995: A summary of the yellow fever outbreak by the country team, UNDP and WHO reports 359 cases of yellow fever, 9 deaths in Buchanan. The true number of cases is probably higher given the level of under reporting. One case has also been confirmed in Bong County. A few suspected cases have been reported in the capital, Monrovia, in Cape Mount, Grand Gedeh and Maryland. The reports on suspected cases in Lofa County were not confirmed by the WHO investigation team which went to the area from 6-11 December. The vaccination campaign in Buchanan which started on 24 November was completed during the second week of December. A vaccination campaign to cover the population in Morovia will start shortly. The Government is supported in the campaigns to vaccinate and inform the population by M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8rs (Belgium & France), UNICEF, WHO and the Norwegian Government. (19.12.95) Yellow fever vaccination certificate is required from all travellers over one year of age going to Liberia.
