Following the confirmation of new cases and deaths in new areas in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, WHO and its partners continue to provide the necessary technical expertise to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. A high-level WHO mission was conducted in Guinea to assess the overall response to EVD and propose a strategic approach to control the outbreak. Among other actions, this includes high-level advocacy with the Governments of the three affected countries to enhance coordination and communication at all national, provincial, and district levels. WHO is also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in addressing community resistance that is emerging in some areas; deploying additional experts in the various specialities (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, and logistics among others); and enhancing cross-border collaboration. The next cross-border meeting between the three countries is planned for 23 June 2014. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.
