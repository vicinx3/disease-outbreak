Although access to diagnostic laboratory materials is limited, most of these cases have been identified as typhoid fever based on clinical diagnosis. The outbreak is due to the overflow from old and poorly maintained sewage systems after heavy rainfalls earlier this year with subsequent contamination of drinking water sources. Currently 10 districts in two provinces are affected, and a continuation of the outbreak is likely as 30-40 new cases are reported every day. A general shortage of drugs, IV fluids, ORS, antibiotics and chlorine for treatment of drinking water, as well as diagnostic materials aggravates the situation. So far the response of the Ministry of Health has included the organization of visits of emergency teams to certain districts and visits to houses which could be affected. Health education materials are being distributed. At the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO has responded to the epidemic by sending an expert team to Tajikistan to assess the situation. Laboratory materials and drugs for the treatment of 2 000 patients were provided. The WHO expert team estimated the needs to combat the outbreak over a 5-month period. UNICEF and International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are already supporting local activities and some of the drugs and medical equipment required will be provided by IFRC.
