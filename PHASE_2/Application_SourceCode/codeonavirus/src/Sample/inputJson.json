The second case, a close friend of the hunter became ill and died in August, and the third and four deaths were in a traditional healer and his assistant who treated him. They occurred late in September and blood specimens from them were confirmed Ebola positive on 4 October by the Centre International de Recherche de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon. The outbreak was brought under control and by 13 November 1997, it numbered 24 cases (clinical and epidemiological case definition from Kikwit) including 17 deaths and only one known contact still requiring surveillance. However, on 27 October, a doctor infected in Libreville by a case linked to the Booué outbreak, went to South Africa for treatment after having developed symptoms. He subsequently infected a nurse in Johannesburg. The nurse become ill on November 2 and died on 24 November. On 26 November, a previously unidentified contact in Gabon died in the village of Djidjii, near Booué, and his burial was attended by his brother and his family from Libreville. His brother came back to Libreville with his three children as well as the children of the deceased. All were regularly followed up and 3 developed symptoms of Ebola infection and died in a Libreville hospital. One of them who became ill on 21 December and died on 30 December, is the last recorded case. As of date 8 January 1997, the outbreak, ongoing since July 1997, has caused 54 cases including 41 deaths, three hospitalised cases and 10 who have recocered. There has been no documented secondary transmission in Libreville other than that of the doctor who flew to South Africa. A total of 167 contacts are still under daily surveillance. All known contacts have been located and are followed up daily. It is possible that few of them may have been infected and will therefore develop disease. International travel: WHO does not recommend any travel restriction either to or from Gabon or any other Ebola endemic country. However, it is recommended for all travellers going to an Ebola endemic area, with the specific intention to provide health care or perform laboratory tests from human or animal specimens, that they be aware of the risk of infection from Ebola and other pathogens and adhere strictly to good hygiene and biosafety practices. Travellers arriving from an Ebola endemic area who have been in physical contact with a case should inform the health authority immediately on their arrival to ensure daily temperature check up for a period of three weeks. There is no epidemiological evidence that persons infected but asymptomatic are infectious to others. Only symptomatic persons (e.g. contact subject with fever) should be considered as suspect cases and, consequently, potentially infectious. Since severely ill patients excreting abundant body fluids are not likely to travel, the risk to travellers of becoming infected by the Ebola virus during travel is considered negligible. However, the risk of health care providers becoming infected through close physical contact with an Ebola patient should be considered, even if statistically low. This is particularly important for health workers in areas receiving a significant number of passengers from Ebola endemic areas. For individuals entering the country from an infected area, a simple information leaflet can be used to inform arriving travellers of the need to report any febrile illness occurring up to 21 days after arrival. A questionnaire may be proposed to help tracing if necessary.

An estimated 120,000 refugees from former camps in Bukavu are in this camp. Fifty-six cases with two deaths have occurred, mostly in age groups over 5 years. Cholera was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur and the University of Kinshasa from stool specimens collected by Médecins Sans Frontières. The cases were detected through the epidemiological surveillance system set up by Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF)/Epicentre in the camp. General health situation: According to MSF/Epicentre the surveillance system registered increasing daily crude mortality rates which reached 4 per 10 000 in the week beginning 6 January. Fifty-four percent of the deaths occurred in children under five. The main causes of death were malnutrition, diarrhoea and malaria. As of 13 January, 200 children had been admitted to intensive feeding centres and more than 1 800 children were given supplementary food rations. The nutritional situation is expected to further deteriorate since only 30 tons of the 70 tons needed can be distributed daily. Acute diarrhoea accounted for 15% of attendance at the health centre and malaria for 40%. Cerebral malaria was the main cause of death in adults. As the camp is located in a high endemicity area and the refugee population is likely to have low immunity against Plasmodium falciparum, malaria is expected to increase during the rainy season which is approaching. The distribution of an adequate food ration to the entire population of the camp is the top health priority. Surveillance and control of acute diarrhoea and malaria are other priorities to reduce excess mortality in the refugee population.

The outbreak area is difficult to access and the full extent of the outbreak is not yet known but reports indicate that up to 300 people may have died from the disease. The first evidence that Rift Valley fever was responsible for the outbreak was obtained on 31 December in the WHO Collaborating Centre at the National Institute for Virology, Johannesburg, South Africa. In testing the first sera available from the outbreak (from 36 human cases and one calf), four sera were PCR-positive and RVF was subsequently confirmed when the virus was isolated from three of them. Antibody to RVF virus was detected in 17 sera by either indirect immunofluorescence or IgG or IgM ELISA tests. Eight of 12 sera which could be retested had haemagglutination inhibition antibody to RVF. Because the population affected is undernourished and subject to various diseases, particularly those associated with a lack of clean drinking water and of health services, other severe diseases that normally occur in the area, such as shigellosis and malaria, may partially explain the large number of deaths in the region. Additional epidemiological studies using a uniform case definition are needed to better understand the scope and nature of the epidemic as well as the support and control measures required. Laboratory investigations, including on samples taken from animals, are continuing at NIV and another WHO Collaborating Centre, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA. Rift Valley fever virus is a member of the family Bunyaviridae and is in the Phlebovirus genus. The virus was first isolated in 1931 during a disease outbreak in livestock on a farm located in the Rift Valley of Kenya. The virus is endemic to Africa, south of the Sahara desert, but infections have periodically extended into Egypt. During epizootics (epidemics in animals), the virus causes spontaneous abortion in ewes and cows and deaths in lambs and calves. In humans, the virus produces a usually non-fatal dengue-like illness. Less frequently, infection results in retinitis, encephalitis and haemorrhagic disease, the latter condition being consistent with the present outbreak. Rift Valley fever virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and many different species can serve as vectors. Humans can also be infected by contact with blood or body fluids from infected animals which may occur during slaughtering of the animals or handling of aborted foetuses. The risk of human-to-human infection through direct contact appears to be very low.

A program of control measures has been instituted: local farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock, and public health information on appropriate precautions has been disseminated to those involved in the livestock industry. Mosquito control measures have been increased in tourist destinations. However, most human cases of RVF reported in the past from South Africa were acquired through contact with diseased animals and their tissues, rather than through mosquito bites, so the general public is not perceived to be at particular risk of contracting the illness. Large outbreaks of RVF occurred in South Africa's inland plateau in 1974-76, and a small outbreak was recorded in 1981 in a coastal area of KwaZulu-Natal, but no disease activity has been detected in the intervening period.

In 1998, the areas involved were lowlands of the Department of La Paz (44%) and west counties of the Department of Santa Cruz (30%). In 1999 all cases have been reported from the southeast counties of Santa Cruz. The trend suggests a southeastward spread of the disease through the country. The current lower reporting of cases outside of the department of Santa Cruz may be attributed to vaccinations implemented during the 1997 and 1998 outbreaks. The presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in Santa Cruz has continuously presented a serious risk to the urbanization of yellow fever. Bolivia has recently developed with the assistance of PAHO a 5 year project to strengthen its immunization program.

The case was born on 13 June 1998, had onset of paralysis on 12 October, after a day of fever on 11 October. The parents took the boy to a local private clinic in a neighbouring township when a sudden onset of flaccid paralysis made him unable to stand or walk (both of which he had been capable of before). Two stool samples were taken, the first on 14 October and the second on 25 October. They were analyzed in the provincial laboratory. Both samples yielded poliovirus isolates, which were later typed and differentiated as P1 wild viruses at the national laboratory in Beijing. At the time that the second sample was taken five contacts were sampled, one of which, a four year old cousin of the infected child, was also positive for wild poliovirus. The case child was unregistered and had received zero doses of polio vaccine. The case belongs to the Sala minority group, a Muslim group of Turkic speaking people whose ancestors migrated to Qinghai from the area of Turkmenistan about seven hundred years ago. There are around 80 000 Sala in China, 60 000 in Qinghai Province (nearly all of which live in Xunhua Sala Autonomous County) and nearly all of the remainder in neighbouring Gansu Province. Adult male Sala travel widely as traders and workers, within Qinghai province and outside to other provinces, including Gansu, Sichuan,Xinjiang, and particularly Tibet, even as far as the border area with Nepal. Neither the case nor the direct family reported a history of travel outside the county in the two months prior to onset. No visit to the family by a traveler from outside the county was reported to occur during the same period. However, the family, including the case, attended a major festival of Sala people in the county capital during the period 25 to 28 September 1999. Up to 30 000 Sala are reported to have attended this gathering. Despite intensive investigation in the area of the case, including searches of health facilities, no evidence of wide-scale circulation of wild poliovirus has yet been found. Surveillance quality including laboratory proficiency in Qinghai Province and in neighbouring provinces is in general good. Indications are therefore that the virus has been recently imported. The Ministry of Health of China is actively collaborating with the global laboratory network including CDC Atlanta, NIID Tokyo and the national laboratories in India. Initial sequencing information on the wild poliovirus show a close similarity to viruses recently circulating in India. The virus is significantly different from those that have been circulating in China up to the last case in 1994. Further genomic sequencing work is proceeding.

Laboratory-related cases occurred after that date in Singapore in September and in Taiwan, China in December of last year. The Guangdong case has been under investigation, with WHO support, since 26 December, when the suspected case was initially reported by Chinese authorities. Previous diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results. In view of the limitations of SARS diagnostic tests, confirmation of positive results by a WHO-designated reference laboratory is required for a definitive diagnosis of SARS. The confirmatory tests were conducted in Hong Kong by both the University of Hong Kong at the Queen Mary Hospital and the Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health. Both laboratories are members of the WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Diagnosis that collectively identified the SARS coronavirus in mid-April 2003, and have considerable diagnostic expertise. The source of infection for this newly confirmed case remains unclear. Several lines of investigation last year suggest that SARS may have originated from contact with wild animals sold for human consumption at live markets in southern China. Studies conducted last year detected a SARS-like virus in some animal species, including the masked palm civet. Retrospective analysis of patient records has linked several of the earliest cases, which began occurring in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, to contact with wild animals. However, no animal reservoir of the SARS coronavirus has been conclusively identified to date. Epidemiological investigations in China have not yet been able to link the patient to exposure to wild animals or any other known or suspected source of the virus. Chinese authorities have introduced several measures as investigation of the case has evolved. The patient has been treated in isolation since his hospitalization on 20 December, four days after the onset of symptoms. All contacts have been traced and followed up. All are reported to be free of symptoms and most have been released from quarantine, suggesting that no further transmission has occurred. Surveillance for additional cases has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces. The single isolated case does not constitute grounds for issuing a SARS alert or recommending any restrictions on travel or trade. At the request of Chinese authorities, additional WHO teams are being sent this week to assist in research aimed at identifying the source of infection and preventing further cases. The first cases of SARS occurred in Guangdong in mid-November 2002.

In the USA, influenza activity persisted at a high level. Sporadic activity of influenza A(H3N2) and B was reported in some countries/regions in Africa (Algeria and Madagascar) and Asia (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan and Thailand). Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized so far have been shown to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like; others have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. Following an initial avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak on a chicken farm in the Republic of Korea, avian influenza spread to 14 other farms. A further 18 farms were under surveillance. Since 23 December 2003, only one more farm, which had been under surveillance from the beginning because of its location, has been confirmed as infected by avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. About 2500 serum samples were collected from persons in contact with suspect infected animals and nearby residents. A serological study will be carried out in mid-January 2004. About 70 human clinical specimens were tested by RT-PCR and all were negative. More than 1000 persons exposed to the virus were given antivirals and some 1500 other individuals were vaccinated. The isolated, single case of H9N2 that occurred in Hong Kong SAR in December 2003 has been further investigated. Sera from the infected boy and family members have been tested in Hong Kong SAR for the presence of antibodies against the H9N2 virus and confirmatory tests are in progress. Serum samples have also been shipped to a WHO Collaborating Centre. Around 120 serum samples were collected from health care workers and other contacts of the infected boy and test results should be available early in the week beginning 12 January. The H9N2 virus isolated from the boy in December 2003 has been sequenced by the National Influenza Centre at the Governmental Virus Unit, Hong Kong SAR and antigenically characterized by WHO Collaborating Centres. The results confirm that the virus is from the G9 group and closely related, though not identical, to previous H9 strains. The WHO H9N2 test kit, distributed to national influenza centres, allows detection of this H9N2 virus. Belgium (20 December 2003). In week 51, influenza activity of A(H3N2) was reported as widespread for the 4th week running, but the number of viruses detected decreased. Canada (20 December 2003). During week 51, widespread influenza activity continued in Ontario, while a continuing decline in activity was observed in the Northwest Territories and Saskatchewan. The influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultation rate was below the baseline. During week 51, 17.0% of 771 laboratory tests were positive for influenza A and 0.2% were positive for influenza B. Of the 374 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 347 (93%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (7%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2). Czech Republic (20 December 2003). A slight but continuing increase of influenza A(H3N2) activity has been noted since week 48. Localized influenza activity was reported in week 51, with 8 influenza A viruses detected. Finland (20 December 2003). Influenza A(H3N2) activity continued to increase in week 51 and was reported as widespread for the 3rd week. All viruses subtyped so far were antigenically related to A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses. France (27 December 2003). Activity of influenza A(H3N2) continued to be widespread but appeared to have stabilized or to be declining in most regions. Germany (27 December 2003). A slight increase in influenza activity was observed in weeks 51 and 52, with localized activity reported. Greece (27 December 2003). Influenza activity increased significantly in week 52; 17 influenza A(H3N2) and 1 A(H1N1) viruses were detected. Israel (27 December 2003). Influenza activity remained at a high level in weeks 51 and 52 although the number of viruses detected started to decline. Latvia (27 December 2003). Influenza activity remained at a low level, but an upward trend has been noted since week 49. Mexico (20 December 2003). Localized activity of influenza A viruses continued in week 51 for the 3rd week running. Norway (27 December 2003). Widespread influenza activity continued to be reported in weeks 51 and 52, but the incidence of ILI decreased slightly; the number of laboratory-confirmed cases also appeared to be levelling off after several weeks of substantial increase. While influenza A(H3) activity was reported in all health regions, A(H1) activity was confined to south-east Norway. Of 753 influenza A viruses detected so far, 163 were subtyped as A(H3), and 25 as A(H1). All A(H3) strains antigenically characterized were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, and all A(H1) strains were A/New Caledonia/20/99-like. Portugal (27 December 2003). The widespread activity of influenza A(H3N2) that had lasted for 5 weeks began to decline rapidly in week 51. In week 52, influenza activity was reported as sporadic with no viruses detected. Russian Federation (27 December 2003). Influenza activity continued to increase in weeks 51 and 52 and was reported as widespread in most regions. Most of the influenza viruses detected were A(H3N2). The Influenza Ecology and Epidemiology Centre antigenically characterized 15 influenza A(H3N2) viruses in the second half of December 2003: 10 were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and 5 were A/Panama/2007/99-like. Spain (27 December 2003). Influenza activity continued to decline in weeks 51 and 52 with an ILI consultation rate of 63 per 100 000 population, which is below the baseline. Switzerland (27 December 2003). Influenza activity continued to increase and was reported as widespread in weeks 51 and 52. All influenza A(H3) viruses antigenically characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like. Ukraine (27 December 2003). Influenza activity continued to increase in weeks 51 and 52, especially in northern and eastern parts of the country where widespread activity was reported. Both influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses were detected. United Kingdom (27 December 2003). Influenza activity continued to decline in weeks 51 and 52. The ILI consultation rate was within the baseline range in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the ILI rate was also declining. During week 51, 5 influenza viruses were detected; no viruses were detected in week 52. Of the viruses antigenically characterized so far, 83 (94.3%) have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like. United States (27 December 2003). The overall ILI consultation rate continued to increase (9.4%), and the pneumonia and influenza mortality (9.0%) was above the epidemic threshold (7.9%) for week 52, although the number of states reporting widespread influenza activity decreased. Widespread influenza activity was reported in 42 states, New York City and the District of Columbia, and regional activity was reported in 8 states during week 52. Of the specimens tested, 28.1% were positive for influenza, with 984 influenza A viruses and 4 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 357 A(H3N2) viruses and 2 B viruses. Of the 357 A(H3N2) viruses characterized, 91 (25.5%) are A/Panama/2007/99-like and 266 (74.5%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like. Other reports. Low influenza activity was reported in Algeria, Austria, Chile, Croatia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Hungary, Iceland, Japan, Madagascar, Serbia & Montenegro, Slovenia and Thailand.

"2004-01-08", "headline": "Update 3: Announcement of suspected SARS case in southern China; Investigation of source of infection for confirmed case begins tomorrow", "main_text": "Health authorities in China have today announced a suspected case of SARS in the southern province of Guangdong. The patient, who has been treated under isolation since 31 December, is a 20-year-old woman from Henan Province who works at a restaurant in Guangzhou, the provincial capital city. The patient felt unwell on 25 December, developed a fever the following day, and sought medical treatment on 31 December. In line with diagnostic and management protocols issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health, she was immediately placed in isolation. She was diagnosed as a suspected case following review by a panel of Chinese SARS experts. Epidemiological investigations and laboratory tests are under way. The patient has been afebrile for the past seven days and is said to be in stable condition. Altogether 100 contacts have been traced and placed under medical observation. At present, no signs or symptoms suggestive of SARS have developed in any of these contacts. The announcement follows Monday’s laboratory confirmation of SARS in a 32-year-old male resident of Guangzhou. The man has fully recovered and has been discharged from hospital. All close contacts of the patient, including health care workers, have remained in good health throughout the observation period, which has now ended. At present, no epidemiological evidence has linked the confirmed case with the suspected case. The possible source of exposure in both cases is under investigation. Symptoms of SARS mimic those of several other respiratory diseases, including many that are more frequently seen during the winter months. Some of these diseases may also give rise to atypical pneumonia. It is likely that numerous other suspected cases will be reported over the coming weeks. All currently available SARS diagnostic tests have shortcomings. In view of these limitations, WHO recommends that specimens taken from suspected SARS cases for laboratory analysis include nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool samples as well as serum. Each specimen should be divided into samples at the bedside, rather than in a laboratory where the risk of contamination is heightened. When positive or inconclusive results are obtained, one of the samples should be sent for independent testing at a WHO-designated SARS reference laboratory. Investigative team arrives in Guangdong A joint team of WHO and Chinese experts has arrived today in Guangdong to investigate possible sources of infection for the confirmed SARS case. Over the coming days, parallel investigations will look at possible human-to-human, animal-to-human, and environmental sources of transmission. Further information about the team is provided on the web site of the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific. Animal experts will also examine conditions surrounding the culling of masked palm civets and other wildlife species, and make recommendations for research that could shed light on the origins of the SARS coronavirus. The SARS virus, which first emerged in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, is thought to have jumped to humans from some unidentified animal or environmental reservoir. Further research is urgently needed to determine sources of human exposure, including the possible involvement of specific animal species. An investigation by a previous joint team of experts, conducted in Guangdong from 20 December to 2 January 2004, found a very high level of awareness of the symptoms of SARS among health care workers and pharmacists, and a very high level of preparedness to introduce appropriate public health measures. Good levels of infection control were in place at all four facilities where the confirmed case was examined or treated.

The cases are in thirteen children and one adult, the mother of a deceased child. To date, eleven of the children and the adult have died. It is not known whether all of these cases were caused by the same pathogen. At present, there is no evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred. No reports indicate that health care workers have been infected. The presence of avian influenza A(H5N1) in samples from three of these cases was confirmed by Hong Kong’s National Influenza Center, which is a member of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Samples have also been sent for analysis to Japan’s National Institute for Infectious Diseases, another member of the WHO influenza network. Results are awaited shortly. WHO is providing support to Vietnamese health authorities in their investigation of the cases and in the prevention of further spread to humans. Avian influenza strains normally infect birds exclusively. The first cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) were identified in 1997 in Hong Kong. The virus infected 18 persons and caused 6 deaths. Genetic studies subsequently linked the outbreak in humans to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry. The immediate culling of around 1.5 million poultry in Hong Kong is thought to have averted a larger outbreak in humans. Other recent outbreaks of avian influenza in humans have caused limited disease. An outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong in February 2003 caused 2 cases and 1 death. An outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza in the Netherlands caused the death of one veterinarian in April 2003, and mild illness in 83 humans. Mild cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) in children occurred in Hong Kong in 1999 (two cases) and in mid-December 2003 (one case). Highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultryLast week, avian influenza virus A(H5N1) was identified as the cause of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in two southern provinces of Viet Nam. To date, the virus, which spreads rapidly and has a mortality in chickens approaching 100%, has resulted in the deaths of 40,000 chickens and the culling of 30,000 more. The relationship between the human and poultry outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Viet Nam is not fully understood at present. WHO and Viet Nam’s Ministry of Health are undertaking investigations to determine the source of the human cases and whether human-to-human transmission has occurred. The situation is also being followed closely by the country’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. An outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) occurred in South Korea in December 2003. On Monday, Japanese authorities announced the death of 6,000 chickens at a single farm as due to infection with the same strain of the virus. These outbreaks mark the first cases of avian influenza in South Korea, and the first cases in Japan since 1925. No human cases of infection with the avian influenza virus have been reported in either of these outbreaks. WHO regards every case of transmission of an avian influenza virus to humans as a cause for heightened vigilance and surveillance. The circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in large numbers of poultry in a growing number of countries is of particular concern. Influenza viruses are highly unstable. The co-circulation of highly pathogenic animal viruses with human viruses could create opportunities for different species-specific viruses to exchange genetic material, giving rise to a new influenza virus to which humans would have little, if any, protective immunity.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["influenza a/h5n1"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2003-12-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": "香港島", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": "Hanoi", "city": "Hanoi"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "South Korea", "state": "Seoul", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": "Hà Nội", "city": null}, {"continent": "Europe", "country": "Netherlands", "state": "Zuid-Holland", "city": "Den Haag"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Japan", "state": "Tōkyō-to", "city": "Shibuya City"}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_13a/en/", "date_of_publication": "2004-01-13", "headline": "Human influenza A(H3N2) activity remains widespread in many countries - update 7", "main_text": "Summary (to 3 January 2004) Influenza activity associated with A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses continued to be widespread in some countries in Europe (Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Switzerland) and in the USA. Compared with the significant increase in previous weeks, influenza A(H3N2) activity seemed to be levelling off although, in several central and eastern European countries (Croatia, Latvia and Switzerland), it continued to increase. So far this season influenza B activity has been low and reported only from Asian countries (Republic of Korea and Thailand). Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized so far have been A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the others have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. Following last week’s update on the A(H5N1) outbreak in the Republic of Korea, no more farms have been reported to be infected by avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. The National Influenza Centre in the Republic of Korea has finished sampling sera from persons in contact with suspect infected animals and nearby residents, and will start serological studies shortly. Avian influenza virus A(H5N1) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of avian influenza in two southern provinces of Viet Nam; there is also information on outbreaks of avian influenza in other provinces. The virus, which spreads rapidly and has a mortality approaching 100% in chickens, has resulted in the deaths of 40 000 chickens and the culling of 30 000 more. Pigs and ducks are also reported to have been infected. Since the end of October 2003, hospitals in Hanoi and surrounding provinces have admitted 14 persons with severe respiratory illness – 13 children and one adult (the mother of a deceased child). To date, 11 of the children and the adult have died. The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Viet Nam and the National Influenza Centre in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (Hong Kong SAR) confirmed that three of these cases were infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. At present, there is no evidence that human-to-human transmission is occurring, and no health care workers have been infected. More information is available on the WHO web site. Belgium. Influenza A(H3N2) activity declined in week 1 (28 December 2003 to 3 January 2004) in terms both of the number of viruses identified and of the influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate. Canada. In week 1, widespread influenza activity was reported in Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and some parts of British Columbia. Overall ILI consultation rate dropped from 79 cases per 1000 consultations in week 52 of 2003 to 36 cases per 1000. Of the 456 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 429 (94%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (6%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2). Croatia. Influenza A(H3N2) activity increased significantly in week 1, with 6 influenza A(H3N2) and 9 A non-subtyped viruses identified. Czech Republic. Influenza A(H3N2) activity remained localized in week 1, with ILI consultation rate below the baseline level. Finland. Influenza A(H3N2) activity remained widespread in week 1, but with a significant decrease in the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases since week 52 of 2003. France. Influenza activity continued to decline in France, although widespread influenza A(H3N2) activity still persisted in many regions. Denmark. Influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported as widespread in week 1, when the ILI consultation rate declined after being above the epidemic threshold for 3 weeks. Germany. A continuing slight increase of regional influenza activity was observed in week 1. Israel. Influenza activity has been in decline since week 51 of 2003. Latvia. Influenza activity remained at a low level, but with a slight increase since week 49 of 2003. Norway. After a peak in weeks 49 and50, clinical and virological indicators showed that influenza A(H3N2) activity, while still widespread in most parts of the country, declined gradually in week 1. Of 882 influenza A virus detected so far, 187 have been subtyped as A(H3) and 26 as A(H1). All A(H3) strains antigenically characterized were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, and all A(H1) strains were A/New Caledonia/20/99-like. Portugal. Influenza activity remained sporadic in week 1 with 1 influenza A(H3N2) virus detected. Republic of Korea. Influenza B activity has been reported since week 49. Romania. Influenza A(H3N2) activity has declined rapidly since week 52 and was reported as sporadic in week 1. Switzerland. Influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported as widespread in week 1, with an increase in the ILI consultation rate in all regions of the country. United Kingdom. Influenza activity continued to decline in week 1, with a falling ILI consultation rate reported in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In England, the ILI consultation rate increased slightly, probably because of the disruption of service over the Christmas and New Year period. During week 1, no influenza virus was detected. Of the viruses antigenically characterized, 102 (95.3%) have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like. United States. The overall ILI consultation rate (6.2%) decreased for the first time this season; the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza and the number of states reporting widespread influenza activity also decreased. However, pneumonia and influenza mortality (9.4%) continued to increase and exceeded the epidemic threshold (8.0%). Widespread influenza activity was reported in 38 states, New York City and the District of Columbia, and regional activity was reported in 9 states during week 1. Of the specimens tested, 20.7%were positive for influenza, with 635 influenza A viruses and 6 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 454 A(H3N2) viruses and 5 B viruses from the USA. Of the 454 A(H3N2) viruses characterized, 98 (21.6%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like and 356 (78.4%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like. Other reports.

with support from WHO staff. The investigation has been undertaken in response to concerns over the laboratory confirmation, on Sunday, of the presence of avian influenza virus H5N1 in three patients who died of severe respiratory illness in late December and early January. The H5N1 strain implicated in the outbreak has now been partially sequenced. All genes are of avian origin, indicating that the virus that caused death in the three confirmed cases had not yet acquired human genes. The acquisition of human genes increases the likelihood that a virus of avian origin can be readily transmitted from one human to another. Investigations are focusing on the source of infection and possibilities of human-to-human transmission. An outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was detected in southern Viet Nam in the beginning of January. The outbreak is now known to have spread to other provinces in the country. Reports indicate that pigs and ducks have also been infected. Yesterday, officials in the Republic of Korea announced the spread of H5N1 avian influenza to an additional farm. Japan is also experiencing an outbreak in poultry caused by the H5N1 virus. In response to these developments, WHO has initiated a series of activities. These include support to national authorities in investigating the outbreaks and enhanced surveillance activities in Asia. WHO has also initiated the development of candidates and reagents for vaccine production, and antigenic and genetic assessments of the H5N1 strain to provide up-to-date diagnostic tests to national influenza centres.

All reported bird epidemics, in the Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, and Japan, are now known to have been caused by an H5N1 strain of avian influenza viruses. Earlier this week, laboratory tests confirmed the presence of the H5N1 variant in samples taken from three patients hospitalized with severe respiratory disease in Hanoi, Viet Nam. Today, laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of H5N1 in an additional Vietnamese patient. All four confirmed cases have been fatal. Several other patients with respiratory illness are under investigation in Hanoi. A case definition of avian influenza in humans is being introduced to facilitate the detection of further cases in Viet Nam, and surveillance is improving as a result. Apart from its severe impact on bird populations, this H5N1 variant has properties that make it a potential risk to human health of considerable significance. H5N1 virus recently isolated from Asian birds has been shown to mutate rapidly and has a known tendency to acquire genes from influenza viruses affecting other species. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of large and highly fatal outbreaks of H5N1 in birds is considered unprecedented. WHO is concerned that these events may indicate that H5N1 is becoming established in birds in this part of the world. Because comprehensive surveillance to detect all cases in bird species is difficult, the true geographical occurrence of the avian epidemic may not be fully appreciated at present. The outbreak in Viet Nam is of particular concern as it suggests the presence of many conditions that are known to have favoured the start of influenza pandemics in the past. Foremost among these is the co-circulation of human influenza viruses with an avian strain that is prone to mutate and has high pathogenicity. H5N1 has, on two occasions in the recent past, caused severe disease with high fatality in humans, and has done so again during the past three weeks. Widespread epidemics in birds increase opportunities for human exposure. Increases in the number of infections in humans increase opportunities for the avian and human strains to exchange genetic material. If a new virus subtype emerges as a result, and if that virus proves capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person to person, then the conditions for the start of an influenza pandemic will have been met. The H5N1 variant isolated from fatal human cases in Viet Nam was partially sequenced earlier this week. All genes are of avian origin, indicating that the virus had not yet acquired genes from the human influenza virus. The acquisition of such genes increases the likelihood that a virus of avian origin can be readily transmitted from person to person. In response to these concerns, WHO and its partners have intensified activities needed to reach three main objectives: to reduce death and disease among humans due to H5N1, to reduce opportunities for a new influenza pandemic to emerge, and to initiate urgently needed international and national research. Specific lines of research will allow a better scientific assessment of the significance of ongoing epidemics in birds for human health in affected countries, and possibly elsewhere. Laboratories in the WHO global influenza network are now conducting studies, at the molecular level, of viruses isolated from infected birds in the different countries, and from the human cases. Such molecular “detective work” can help identify the origins of currently circulating viruses, determine how they might be related, and thus shed considerable light on how the viruses are evolving. Despite the seriousness of the current outbreak in humans, WHO believes that it can be controlled, provided decisive measures are taken to eliminate the animal reservoir for human infections. Surveillance for human respiratory disease in this part of the world has been intensified. WHO has alerted countries regarding the need to intensify surveillance for animal infections. Culling of infected or potentially exposed poultry flocks is a standard control measure that has proved effective in halting past epidemics of avian influenza in several countries. H5N1 is the only one of the 15 subtypes of avian influenza that has, to date, caused severe outbreaks in humans. In Hong Kong in 1997, H5N1 caused disease in 18 persons, of whom 6 died. In February, 2003, H5N1 infected two persons, causing the death of one. Three incidents of human infection with other avian subtypes, namely H7N7 and H9N2, were documented in 1999 and 2003, but caused only mild illness and altogether only 1 death. During the 1997 outbreak of H5N1 influenza in humans, the culling – within three days – of Hong Kong’s entire poultry population is thought, by many experts, to have averted an influenza pandemic.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["influenza a/h5n1"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2003-02-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Massachusetts", "city": "Natick"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Singapore", "state": null, "city": "Singapore"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "North Carolina", "city": "Cary"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "India", "state": "Tamil Nadu", "city": "Pollachi"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": "Hanoi", "city": "Hanoi"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": "Hồ Chí Minh", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Georgia", "city": "Richmond Hill"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Aydın", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Thailand", "state": "เชียงใหม่", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Japan", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": null, "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_19/en/", "date_of_publication": "2004-01-19", "headline": "Avian influenza A(H5N1) in humans in Viet Nam - update 3", "main_text": "Laboratory tests have confirmed a fifth case of H5N1 avian influenza in humans in Viet Nam.

One of these steps concerns the initiation of research needed for vaccine production. As a precautionary measure, WHO is moving forward with the procedures needed to rapidly produce a new influenza vaccine capable of protecting humans against the H5N1 strain of avian influenza recently detected in Viet Nam. These procedures have been initiated following mounting concern over 5 laboratory confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Hanoi, Viet Nam in recent weeks. All 5 cases were fatal. The human deaths in Viet Nam coincide with historically unprecedented epidemics, in bird populations, of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Viet Nam, the Republic of Korea, and Japan. The epidemic in birds is the first in Japan since 1925, and the first ever documented in Viet Nam and the Republic of Korea. Prototype viruses for vaccine production are being prepared by laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Network. Several laboratories in this network have the high-security (biosafety level 3) facilities needed to safely conduct work on a highly pathogenic virus such as H5N1. Prototype viruses are then supplied to manufacturers as the “seed stock” for vaccine production. Laboratories in Hong Kong and Japan have isolated the virus from specimens obtained from two of the laboratory confirmed fatal cases in Viet Nam. The virus is now being analysed at the molecular level to obtain information about its origin and its relationship to viruses currently circulating in birds and possibly other animals. These studies will also determine the antigenic and genetic characteristics of the virus that are needed to produce a candidate vaccine. Using laboratories in the WHO influenza network, and following procedures established by WHO to detect and respond to a new influenza virus subtype, a prototype virus could be made available to vaccine manufacturing companies within about four weeks. Candidate vaccines were developed last year, by network laboratories in London, UK and Memphis, Tennessee, for protection against the H5N1 virus strain which caused two cases and one death in Hong Kong last February. If the virus isolated from the fatal cases in Viet Nam proves sufficiently similar to the 2003 H5N1 strain in Hong Kong, the existing candidate vaccines could expedite the availability of a new vaccine. The candidate prototype vaccines have already undergone basic tests to ensure safety and effectiveness, genetic stability, and antigenic homogeneity. Several steps are needed before a new influenza vaccine can be ready for use in humans. Virus for use in influenza vaccines is grown in chicken eggs. However, because H5N1 is so deadly in chicken embryos, a new technique, known as “reverse genetics”, is required to prepare the prototype H5N1 virus for vaccine production. Reverse genetics merges selected genetic information of the virus taken from actual cases with a laboratory virus. The resulting virus is recognized by the human immune system, and causes a protective immune response, but no disease. The virus can also be genetically modified so that it is no longer lethal to chicken embryos. As a further advantage, use of the reverse genetics technique produces a prototype virus with predictable growth during vaccine production. The prototype virus is then used by manufacturers to produce sample vaccines for clinical testing. WHO will offer support in the coordination of these clinical trials, which are needed to determine the amount of vaccine and number of doses required to confer protection, also in different age groups. As part of its influenza pandemic preparedness plans, WHO also has in place procedures for making specific recommendations to vaccine manufacturing companies and licensing agencies for the composition and approval of a vaccine during an influenza pandemic. The WHO Global Influenza Laboratory Network was established in 1947 to guide the yearly composition of influenza vaccines. The oldest disease surveillance network at WHO, it also operates as an early warning system for detecting conditions, including novel viruses, that could give rise to another influenza pandemic. Historically, influenza pandemics have spread rapidly around the world, causing high mortality and affecting all age groups, including young and healthy adults.

Tsunami in South-East Asia and the risk from avian influenza Concerns have been raised about whether the recent tsunami in South-East Asia may have increased the risk of an influenza pandemic. The level of pandemic risk depends on how widespread H5N1 is in domestic poultry, how often the virus is transmitted to humans, and the concurrent circulation of human influenza viruses. Areas with the highest prevalence of avian influenza were not directly affected by the tsunami, thus there is no inherent increased risk of the emergence of the pandemic strain due to the tsunami itself. However, any activity that spreads avian influenza increases the possibility of the emergence of a pandemic virus. The risk of importing avian influenza into areas affected by the tsunami can be minimized by controlling the movement of poultry from areas where outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred. It is also important to ensure that infected poultry are kept out of the food chain, including emergency food relief activities.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["influenza a/h5n1"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2004-01-xx xx:xx:xx to 2005-01-05 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Kansas", "city": "Kansas City"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": "Hồ Chí Minh", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": "Hà Nội", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Vietnam", "state": "Tien Giang", "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_01_14/en/", "date_of_publication": "2005-01-14", "headline": "Avian influenza – situation in Viet Nam – update 3", "main_text": "WHO has received informal reports of two additional cases of H5N1 infection in Viet Nam.

Both cases were fatal. The first case was a 14-year-old boy from the rural district of Dogubayazit, in the eastern province of Agri, which borders the Islamic Republic of Iran and Armenia. He was hospitalized in Van Province on 1 January and died the same day. The second case was his 15-year-old sister, also hospitalized on 1 January. She died on 5 January. Earlier this week, Turkish authorities had ruled out avian influenza in these cases based on preliminary test results from samples taken from the nose and throat. Subsequent tests of additional patient specimens taken from the lungs produced positive results. Patient samples were sent today to a WHO collaborating centre in the United Kingdom for further analysis. The samples have now arrived; results are expected within the next days. Turkish health authorities have informed WHO that, since 1 January, a total of 11 patients (including the two confirmed fatal cases) have been hospitalized in Van Province with symptoms suggesting infection with avian influenza. Most patients are children between the ages of six and fifteen years and all reside in the Dogubayazit district. Two of the children are siblings of the two confirmed cases. Following a request by the Ministry of Health, an initial team of experts from WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Commission is travelling today to Turkey to collaborate with the authorities in their investigation of the situation. Initial information about the confirmed cases suggests that the children acquired their infection following close contact with chickens. Deaths of chickens are known to have occurred in the Dogubayazit district near the end of last year. Although no poultry outbreak has been officially reported in the district, a confirmed outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens and ducks was reported on 27 December in the adjacent province of Igdir. National authorities have informed WHO that Dogubayazit district has been placed under quarantine; no people or animals are allowed to move in or out of the district. Culling operations are currently under way. The two Turkish cases mark the first confirmed reports of human infection with avian influenza outside East Asia. Since January 2004, a total of 142 human cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and China. The cases in Turkey bring the number of affected countries to six, from which 144 cases have now been reported. Turkey reported its first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in mid-October of last year. That outbreak, which occurred in the northwestern part of the country, was attributed to contact between domestic poultry and migratory waterfowl. The outbreak in Igdir and other suspected outbreaks in this part of the country are thought to have occurred following introduction of the virus by migratory birds.

Both cases are children, aged five and eight years, and both are hospitalized. This brings the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Turkey to four. Two of these cases were fatal. A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom has today confirmed detection of the H5N1 virus in samples taken from the two fatal cases. The Ministry of Health has also announced a third death, presumably caused by the H5N1 virus, in a 12-year-old girl. The girl, who died on 6 January, is a sibling of the two children who died. A fourth child in the family, a six-year-old boy, is also hospitalized. Tests on samples from these patients are ongoing; neither is laboratory confirmed at present. According to Turkish authorities, some 30 patients are being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection at a hospital in Van Province. Most of the patients are children, and the majority come from the rural district of Dogubayazit. Plans for a team of international experts to travel today to Van Province have been deferred because of adverse weather conditions. Government officials are assisting the team in finding a rapid mode of transportation to the affected area in the eastern part of the country. To date, all evidence indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased poultry. Contact between people and poultry has likely increased during the present cold weather, when the custom among many rural households is to bring poultry into their homes. Tests have shown that the virus can survive in bird faeces for at least 35 days at low temperatures (4oC). Based on experiences during the avian H5N1 outbreaks in Asia, behaviours that carry an especially high risk of infection include the slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation for consumption of diseased poultry. These behaviours tend to occur most frequently in rural areas where populations traditionally slaughter and consume birds once deaths or signs of illness are seen in poultry flocks. In recent days, vigilance for outbreaks of the disease in poultry has increased considerably. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have now been confirmed in six provinces in the eastern and south-eastern part of the country. Outbreaks at additional sites in the area are under investigation.

Of the five patients announced on Sunday, three are from Ankara Province and include two brothers, aged five and two years, and a 65-year-old man. All three patients are hospitalized in Ankara. The additional two cases, a nine-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother, are from the Dogubeyazit district in Agri Province, and are hospitalized in the city of Van. The five cases announced today are from Kastamonu, Corum, and Samsun provinces, bordering the Black Sea in the north-central part of the country, and from Van Province. This brings the total number of cases in Turkey, confirmed by laboratory tests there, to 14. Of these patients, two have died. WHO will add these numbers to its cumulative total following further verification by an external H5 reference laboratory. The quality of laboratory testing at Turkey’s National Influenza Centre in Ankara is high. Results from tests conducted there last week were fully confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. WHO considers it likely that test results on the newly announced cases will be confirmed by the UK laboratory, where samples are being sent for further analysis. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known to infect humans. In the event of a confirmed H5N1 outbreak in birds, it is expected that human cases of avian influenza will be caused by the same virus strain. The initial WHO team, accompanied by the Turkish Minister of Health, arrived in Van Province yesterday evening. The team is now investigating the epidemiological situation, assessing risk factors and control measures, and discussing with local authorities the possible need for additional equipment and supplies. The team will also be assessing patients at the Van hospital where some 38 people are currently being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection. The initial investigation has found no evidence that the virus has increased its transmissibility or is spreading from person to person. Most persons under investigation are children, often from the same family, and almost all have a documented link to dead or diseased poultry. Outbreaks in poultry are now known to be occurring in several parts of the country. In recent days, the Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in birds in 10 of the country’s 81 provinces. Extensive culling is under way, and several other possible outbreaks are under investigation.

Although no poultry outbreaks have been officially reported in this province, it is located near areas with confirmed outbreaks in birds. The situation in birds continues to evolve, with several new outbreaks under investigation in new parts of the country. All evidence to date indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased birds. The Turkish government has launched an intensive public awareness campaign. Better public understanding of the disease, supported by more complete data on disease activity in birds, could help to reduce the risk of additional human cases, pending control of the disease in birds. As the majority of confirmed cases and persons under investigation are children, it is particularly important that messages about high-risk behaviours reach children. Some 100,000 treatment courses of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) arrived in Turkey Friday evening. This supply, which is being used for both the treatment of patients and prophylaxis of persons at risk, is considered by Turkish health officials to be adequate for responding to the current situation.

The patients are residents of Sanliurfa Province, near the southern border with Syria, and Siirt Province, which is adjacent to Van in the eastern part of the country. Human cases have now been reported from nine of the country’s 81 provinces. Both patients are young children, aged four and six years, and both have a documented history of direct contact with diseased birds. In Sanliurfa Province, outbreaks in backyard poultry are now thought to date back to late November 2005. Altogether, agricultural officials have confirmed poultry outbreaks in 11 provinces and are investigating possible outbreaks in an additional 14 provinces across the country. Laboratory tests completed today in Turkey have detected the H5 virus subtype in post-mortem specimens taken from a 12-year-old girl, from Agri Province, who died 7 January. The child was the sibling of two other patients who died earlier. Their infection with the H5N1 virus was subsequently confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Health is now reporting 18 laboratory-confirmed cases, of which three, all from the same family, have been fatal. Arrangements have been made to send specimens from several patients to the UK collaborating laboratory for further analysis. Due to official holidays in Turkey, specimens are not expected to arrive in the UK before Monday. The head of the collaborating laboratory is now in Ankara to support diagnostic work at the country’s national influenza centre. Ways are being sought to expedite the testing of patient samples. High awareness of the disease in the Turkish population, combined with almost daily reports of poultry outbreaks in new areas, has resulted in a large number of people concerned about exposure and seeking reassurance. The rapid assessment of patients with a possible exposure history is providing a unique opportunity to learn more about the disease in humans. It is also generating data that can be used to assess the efficacy of antiviral drugs, as most people with an exposure history or respiratory symptoms are receiving oseltamivir either prophylactically or very early after the onset of symptoms. Members of the international teams, in Van Province and Ankara, are today working with local experts to plan relevant studies. These studies should deepen understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, including the possibility that any human-to-human transmission may have occurred, the vulnerability to infection of health care workers and other occupationally-exposed groups, and the possibility that milder forms of the disease might be occurring in the general population. All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred. As in Asia, contact with infected birds is the principal source of infection. The risk of infection for travellers to Turkey is negligible provided direct contact with dead or diseased domestic and wild birds is avoided. The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on influenza at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, has today completed genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses recovered from the first two fatal human cases in the Turkish outbreak. Information provided to WHO indicates that these viruses are very similar to current avian H5N1 viruses isolated from birds in Turkey. They are also closely related to viruses isolated from the large outbreak in migratory birds that occurred at the Qinghai Lake nature reserve in China, beginning in late April of last year. These analyses indicate that the Turkish viruses are sensitive to both classes of antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir and amantadine. WHO and collaborating experts will review the data on amantadine sensitivity. Oseltamivir remains the drug of first choice recommended by WHO. Virus from one of the patients shows mutations at the receptor-binding site. One of the mutations has been seen previously in viruses isolated from a small outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (two cases, one of which was fatal) and from the 2005 outbreak in Viet Nam. Research has indicated that the Hong Kong 2003 viruses bind preferentially to human cell receptors more so than to avian cell receptors. Researchers at the Mill Hill laboratory anticipate that the Turkish virus will also have this characteristic. Interpretation of the significance of this finding for human health will depend on clinical and epidemiological data now being gathered in Turkey. All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring in any country experiencing human cases. The present WHO level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3: human infections with a new virus subtype are occurring, but the vast majority of these infections are acquired directly from animals.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["influenza a/h5n1"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2005-11-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": "香港島", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Ağrı", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Louisiana", "city": "New Orleans"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Syria", "state": "Damascus Governorate", "city": "Damascus"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "İstanbul", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Ankara", "city": "Ankara"}, {"continent": "Europe", "country": "United Kingdom", "state": "England", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Van", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Virginia", "city": "Keswick"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "İzmir", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Texas", "city": "Turkey"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Florida", "city": "Orlando"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Siirt", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Şanlıurfa", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Van", "city": "Van"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Virginia", "city": "Roanoke"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Turkey", "state": "Ankara", "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_01_14/en/", "date_of_publication": "2006-01-14", "headline": "Avian influenza – situation in Indonesia", "main_text": "The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.

The child developed symptoms on 5 January and was hospitalized on 13 January. He is being treated at a hospital in Erzurum Province. Like the two cases confirmed on 16 January, also from Dogubayazit, exposure in this case occurred prior to the government’s launch of an intensive public education campaign. Rapid surveys conducted in the most severely affected eastern part of the country have found an almost universal awareness of the disease and of the risk factors for infection. This awareness has been accompanied by behavioural changes that are expected to reduce opportunities for human infections to occur. As the virus is now known to be present in birds in many parts of the country, some additional human cases should be anticipated in the immediate future. The number of these cases is, however, expected to decline as high-risk behaviours become less common and culling operations, which are presently under way, reduce the number of infected birds. The newly confirmed case brings the total in Turkey to 21. Of these cases, four were fatal. All four were residents of Dogubayazit. A second shipment of laboratory specimens arrived yesterday at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.

Both patients had been on treatment with oseltamivir for two days before the clinical samples that yielded the viruses were taken. The two patients from whom samples were taken were a 16 year-old female and a 26 year-old male from Gharbiyah Province, Egypt.1 They were a niece and uncle, respectively, who lived in the same house. The girl was admitted to a hospital on 19 December 2006, while the man was admitted on 17 December. On 21 December they began receiving 2 tablets per day of oseltamivir. On 23 December they were moved to a referral hospital. The samples which have so far been tested were taken from the two patients on 23 December. The girl died on 25 December and the man died on 28 December 2006. In this and all other H5N1 investigations there is close, ongoing coordination between Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population (MOH&P) and WHO. It was Egypt's monitoring and rapid virological analysis conducted at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Cairo that initially allowed the diagnoses of H5N1 to be made. Confirmatory testing and genetic sequencing was done at NAMRU-3 and at two WHO Collaborating Centres located in Atlanta, USA and London, UK. At this time there is no indication that oseltamivir resistance is widespread in Egypt or elsewhere. WHO is not making any changes in antiviral treatment recommendations for H5N1-infected persons published in June 2006 because the clinical level of resistance of these mutations is not yet well established. Current laboratory testing suggests that the level of reduced susceptibility is moderate. This mutation has previously been identified in Viet Nam in one case in 2005. Moreover, these mutations are not associated with any known change in the transmissibility of the virus between humans. Based on these considerations, the public health implications at this time are limited. Finally, these findings do not indicate a need for a change in phase level. The WHO pandemic preparedness level remains at three. The Egyptian authorities, WHO and its Collaborating Centres will continue to share with the public all relevant information from the on-going investigations and analyses as soon as it becomes available. 1The ages and dates in this update related to the two patients, may differ slightly from earlier reports, but reflect the most recent information provided to WHO.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["influenza a/h5n1"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2006-12-17 xx:xx:xx to 2006-12-19 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Georgia", "city": "Smyrna"}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Egypt", "state": "Cairo Governorate", "city": "Cairo"}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Egypt", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Europe", "country": "United Kingdom", "state": "England", "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Egypt", "state": "Cairo Governorate", "city": null}, {"continent": "Europe", "country": "Italy", "state": "Sicilia", "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Egypt", "state": "Gharbia Governorate", "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/2007_01_22a/en/", "date_of_publication": "2007-01-22", "headline": "Avian influenza - situation in Egypt - update 2", "main_text": "The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has announced a new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection.

The outbreaks in these 20 countries resulted in 1,517 cases, and cost upwards of 500 million US Dollars in international emergency outbreak response funds. In 2008, northern Nigeria is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1, which has spread internationally into nearby countries in west Africa. Since April 2008, cases due to type 1 polio genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria have been detected in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, Mali and Togo. In 2008, Nigeria accounts for 80% of type 1 polio cases in the world. In addition to international spread of type 1 polio, wild poliovirus type 3 originating from northern Nigeria has also been reported in Chad and Niger. The risk of additional importations into these west African countries depends fully on the quality of outbreak response activities in Nigeria and the re-infected countries themselves. In the second half of 2008, Nigeria has conducted large-scale rounds of emergency polio immunization campaigns in the northern states in July and August, as well as in November when oral polio vaccine (OPV) was added to an integrated measles vaccination campaign. Additional nationwide campaigns are planned for late January and again in February. To minimize the risk of onward spread of polio from Ghana, in particular into Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana has conducted large-scale polio immunization campaigns in October, November and December. The feasibility of conducting preventive campaigns in Côte d'Ivoire is currently being explored. Elsewhere in west Africa, large-scale polio immunization campaigns have been carried out and/or are being planned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo. Given these risks, it is important that countries across west Africa strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information. The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission currently are in parts of central, eastern and southeastern Europe, North Africa, and South Asia. In Europe, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread throughout the continent and there continues to be intense virus circulation in several countries of central, eastern, and southeastern Europe - particularly in Poland, Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia - where a high a intensity of respiratory diseases activity has been recently reported. Among countries testing more than 20 clinical specimens from sentinel sites in the past week, the greatest proportions of samples testing positive for influenza were observed in Greece (72%), Georgia (54%), Switzerland (49%), Portugal (48%), Germany (48%), Luxembourg (40%), Romania (30%), Poland (25%), and Albania (23%). In most of western and northern Europe, rates of ILI/ARI continued to decline substantially, and in many places have returned to near seasonal baselines. Sporadic cases of seasonal H3N2 influenza have been identified in Western Europe but in very small numbers. Crude mortality rates among most European countries, measured as the cumulative number of pandemic H1N1 influenza associated deaths per million population, appear to be within the same range as rates observed elsewhere in northern and southern hemisphere, suggesting a relatively consistent global pattern of mortality. In North Africa and West Asia, limited data suggest that influenza transmission remains active. Although west Asia may have already experienced a peak in influenza activity, parts of North Africa continues to report increasing respiratory diseases activity, particularly in Egypt. Elevated levels of ILI activity and increased influenza virus detections were observed during November and December in Algeria and Morocco, but activity has likely peaked in the later. In South Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread and active across the subcontinent - particularly in northern India, Nepal, and in Sri Lanka - where an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported. In Southeast Asia, influenza transmission remains geographically regional to widespread; however, overall influenza activity appears to be low but variable. Localized increases in ILI were reported in parts of Thailand over the past three weeks. In Vietnam, after a period of substantial influenza transmission during September through November, activity declined significantly in December. In Laos and Cambodia, overall respiratory disease activity was reported to be decreasing during most of December. In East Asia, influenza transmission remains widespread and active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity continued to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong SAR (China). Pandemic H1N1 is clearly still the predominant circulating virus but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China. Slight increases in rates of ILI were again reported in Mongolia. In central Asia, there is evidence of declining rates of ILI/ARI since respiratory disease activity recently peaked in late November and early December in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, respectively. In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low. In North America, peak influenza activity occurred during early, mid, and late October in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively. In all three countries, as expected, a substantially greater number of cases were recorded during the fall and winter transmission period as compared to spring and summer transmission period. In Canada, after experiencing substantial influenza activity unusually early during the fall and winter period, rates of ILI have now dropped below the historical seasonal baseline. In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. This suggests that the level of population immunity in areas that experienced intense, high-level transmission during a winter season is high enough to prevent sustained transmission from recurring during the summer when the virus is less transmissible. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

Côte d'Ivoire has recently conducted an outbreak response in the border health districts of Minignan and Madinani. The case in Guinea was a 35-year-old woman from the village of Malikila, sub-prefecture of Faralako, prefecture of Mandiana. On 23 November 2009, she presented with a clinical syndrome of fever and jaundice. The case was detected by cross-border investigation of the outbreak in Côte d'Ivoire. Following an outbreak investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health, a further six suspected cases were found in the sub-prefecture of Faralako, Mandiana-Centre and Saladou. These cases are under laboratory investigation. The regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, confirmed the yellow fever case by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Other haemorrhagic fevers were excluded by specific tests. Following the detection of this case, the MoH has decided to vaccinate the entire population of the Mandiana prefecture. A total of 12 sub-prefectures with 290 292 people are targeted for an emergency reactive mass vaccination campaign, scheduled for the third week of January 2010. Vaccines have been made available from the global emergency vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) with funding from the GAVI Alliance and ECHO. Guinea is one of the high-risk endemic countries in Africa where a series of preventive mass vaccination campaigns has been implemented since 2007. Mandiana prefecture is one of the 25 prefectures in the country considered to be at highest risk of yellow fever. The prefecture was selected for preventive mass vaccination during the YF National Risk Assessment meeting in September 2008, however, the national campaign has not yet taken place due to limited vaccine supply.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information. The most intense areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of North Africa, South Asia, and east and southeastern Europe. In North Africa, limited data suggest that transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active throughout the region, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. In West Asia, limit data suggest that pandemic virus continues to circulate widely with a number of countries likely having already experienced a peak in activity prior to December. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the northern African and western Asian regions with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses. In South Asia, the northern and western parts of the subcontinent continued to experience active influenza transmission. In Nepal, increasing ARI activity and geographically regional to widespread influenza activity was reported during December and January. In India, overall activity may have peaked during mid to late December, however transmission has been regionally variable with a recently increasing trend in the western states, active but decreasing transmission in the northern states, and overall low activity in the eastern and southern states. In Sri Lanka, geographically widespread transmission with increasing trend of respiratory diseases was reported throughout December, however activity may have recently plateaued. In Europe, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread throughout the continent, however, overall activity continued to decline substantially since November. A moderate intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported in Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, and Switzerland, however, rates of ILI/ARI have been decreasing or have plateaued in all. At least four countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory specimens reported greater than 25% specimens were positive for influenza (Romania, Georgia, Germany, and France). The overall rate of specimens testing positive for influenza fell to 22% in Europe after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses. In East Asia, influenza activity remains widespread but continues to decline overall. In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but has declined since peaking at the end of November 2009. Although influenza transmission remains active and regionally variable in China, overall activity has declined substantially since peaking during mid November 2009 in northern and southern China. In Hong Kong SAR (China), influenza activity remained stably elevated but substantially lower than a large peak of activity during late September and early October 2009. In Mongolia, rates of ILI have been elevated above seasonal baseline since late October 2009 but declined substantially since a peak of activity was observed during November 2009. In DPR Korea, geographically regional influenza activity with increasing respiratory diseases trend was reported during early January 2010. Pandemic H1N1 continues to be the predominant circulating virus in the region but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China. In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low. In North America, peak influenza activity occurred during early, mid, and late October in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively. Small areas of increased influenza activity may be occurring in central and northern Mexico. In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. This suggests that the level of population immunity in areas that experienced intense, high-level transmission during a winter season is high enough to prevent sustained transmission from recurring during the summer when the virus is less transmissible.

The overall situation in largely unchanged since last week. The most intense transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to occur in North Africa, South Asia, and in limited areas of Eastern Europe. Overall pandemic influenza activity in the temperate northern hemisphere peaked between late October and late November 2009 and has continued to decline since. In North Africa, limited data suggest that transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically widespread and active throughout the region, but has likely recently peaked in most places. During early January 2010 only the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya reported an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity. Egypt is now reporting a declining trend after increases in respiratory diseases activity throughout December 2009, suggesting a recent peak in activity during early January 2010. In West Asia, limited data suggests pandemic influenza virus transmission remains geographically widespread however overall activity has been declining in most places during December and January. In South Asia, active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists in the northern and western parts of the subcontinent, however overall activity has recently peaked. In India, influenza activity has been largely confined to the northern and western states; activity in the northern states peaked during mid December 2009 and in the western states during early January 2010. In Nepal, active transmission of virus persists, and the trend in respiratory diseases activity remains unchanged since the previous week after reporting continuous increases in activity since late October 2009. In Europe, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains geographically widespread across parts of western, central, and southeastern Europe, however overall influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most countries The areas of most intense transmission currently include Poland, Austria, Estonia, Romania, Hungary, and Moldova; however, in all but Romania, ILI activity has declined significantly since peaking in November. The overall rate of specimens testing positive for influenza fell to 20% in Europe after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses. In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains widespread but continues to decline in most places. Mongolia reported a very high intensity of respiratory diseases during early January 2010; rates of ILI have been elevated above expected seasonal levels since late October 2009 but are well below a significant peak of activity observed during November 2009. In Japan, overall influenza activity continued to decline since peaking at the end of November 2009, however regional increases in activity were observed during late December on the southern island of Okinawa. In China, Hong Kong SAR, and Chinese Taipei pandemic influenza activity remains widespread but continues to decline or remain stable. Pandemic H1N1 continues to be the predominant circulating virus in the region but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China. In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places.

Although much of the temperate northern hemisphere passed a peak of fall and wintertime pandemic influenza activity between late October and late November 2009, virus transmission remain active in several later affected areas, particularly in North Africa, limited areas of eastern and southeastern Europe, and in parts of South and East Asia. In North Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active and geographically widespread, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and in Egypt, although most countries in the region appeared to have recently passed a peak of activity during December 2009 or January 2010. In west Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues be geographically regional to widespread, however activity levels have continued to decline or remain low since December 2009. In South Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains active but geographically variable. Recent peaks in activity were noted during late December and early January 2010 in northern India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Influenza activity remained stable but elevated in western India, continued to decline substantially in northern India, and remained low overall in southern and eastern India. In Bangladesh, regional spread influenza activity and a low intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported. In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active, however, overall activity continued to decline in most countries. An increasing trend in respiratory diseases with localized spread was reported for DPR Korea. In the Republic of Korea, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active (>20% respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic H1N1), however, overall activity continue to decline since peaking during November 2009. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decline, however high levels of transmission persist on the southern island of Okinawa. In northern and southern China, pandemic virus isolations have declined substantially since peaking early to mid November 2009, however, in recent weeks detections of influenza type B viruses have increased. In southeast Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists, but current activity levels are low. In Vietnam, influenza activity has declined substantially since peaking during October and November 2009. In Thailand, focal outbreaks of influenza were reported from a few provinces in northern and central parts of the country, however, overall ILI activity remains low. In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically regional to widespread in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the continent, however, overall activity continues to decline in most places. Several countries (Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and the Russian Federation) reported slight increases in the levels of ARI or ILI activity, however in most, levels remain well below recent peaks in activity. The overall rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (16%) continued to fall since peaking (45%) during early November 2009. In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. Of note, detections of RSV have increased in a few countries in the Americas, which may partially account for elevated ILI activity in those areas, particularly among young children. In the US and Canada, pandemic influenza virus detections and the numbers of severe and fatal cases have decline substantially as rates of ILI have fallen below seasonal baselines. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places. In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant virus circulating worldwide. Seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating at low levels in parts of Africa, east and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information. In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity continues to decline or remain low in most regions since peaking during late October and November 2009. Several areas continue to have evidence of active but declining transmission, particularly in North Africa and in limited areas of Eastern Europe and East Asia. In North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread but overall activity has been declining since peaking during late December 2009 and early January 2010. During January 2010, a substantial decline in the number of pandemic virus isolations and new cases was observed in Morocco and Egypt, respectively. In West Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread to regional, but overall activity remained low. In South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active but geographically localized to regional. The overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported to be low to moderate in most places. In India, influenza activity continued to decline in all regions of the country, however, the most active areas of transmission currently are in the western states. An overall peak in the number of pandemic H1N1 cases was recorded in India during mid December 2009, and the majority of these cases were identified in the northern and western states of India. In Thailand, overall ILI activity remained low, however focal increase in activity were observed in several central and northern provinces. In East Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread across the region, however, overall activity continued to decline. In Japan, overall influenza activity continues to decline but transmission remains higher on the southern island of Okinawa than in other places. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), rates of ILI continued to decline to near baseline after a substantial wave of activity which peaked during early to mid November 2009. In Mongolia, after a period of sustained elevated ILI activity since early November 2009, levels of ILI have recently fallen to the expected seasonal range. In northern and southern China, rates of ILI have returned to levels seen during recent seasons; however, approximately 30% of respiratory specimens tested were positive for influenza suggesting that active transmission of influenza viruses persists. Of note in China, in recent weeks the circulation of pandemic influenza H1N1 continued to decline with a concomitant increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses (pandemic H1N1 and seasonal Type B viruses accounted for 34% and 66% of all influenza viruses detected, respectively). Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus also persists in Hong Kong SAR (China), although at significantly lower levels than an earlier peak of activity during September and October 2009. In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active in a limited number of countries as overall activity remained low in most places. At least seven countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory samples reported that >20% of samples had tested positive for influenza (Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Greece, Luxembourg, and Romania); however, in all seven, rates of illness remained well below earlier peaks of activity. Small increases in ILI/ARI have been reported over the past two reporting weeks in Slovakia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation. The overall rate of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza fell to 14% after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009. In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places. In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, East and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions were also notified, leading to product withdrawal from a number of non-EU countries. PIP implants have also been sold under the trade name of M-Implants and in April 2010 the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate prohibited all trade and usage of both products in the Netherlands. On 23 December 2011, the French authorities published a recommendation that French residents with PIP breast implants should consider having these removed as a preventive measure. Following this, other national health authorities have issued their own recommendations that have ranged from preventive removal of PIP silicone breast implants, to close monitoring and follow up of persons with these implants. Adverse events of approved breast implants include implant rupture and leakage. While the rupture rate of PIP prostheses was observed to be higher than expected in France, rates reported by other national authorities vary. Testing of PIP implants carried out by AFSSAPS found that the quality of implants varied, therefore increasing the risk of rupture. AFSSAPS also found that the gel containing non-approved silicone was an irritant to tissue, and when leaking could give rise to inflammation and pain. More information is needed about the risks associated with these implants and how they compare with other implants on the market, and on product distribution, use and surveillance. PIP and M-Implants silicone breast prostheses have been distributed to many countries around the world. Both standard and substandard silicone has been used to produce PIP implants. Persons with PIP or M-Implant prostheses should consult their doctor or surgeon if they suspect rupture, have pain or inflammation or any other concerns. Affected persons and physicians should take note of their national health authority recommendations and act accordingly. It is, furthermore, important to consider strengthening adverse event reporting of medical devices.

Virus has been detected in sewage only; no case of paralytic polio has been reported. Genetic sequencing shows that the virus strains are closely related to virus from northern Sindh, Pakistan. Pakistan is one of three countries worldwide affected by ongoing indigenous transmission of WPV (together with Nigeria and Afghanistan). The isolates were detected through routine environmental surveillance in Egypt that involves regular testing of sewage water from multiple sites. Following detection of these isolates, the Government of Egypt is implementing a comprehensive response in line with international outbreak response guidelines issued by the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Resolution WHA59.1. On 2-6 February, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) were conducted in the two areas of Cairo from where the environmental samples had been collected, reaching more than 155,000 children with trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV). In early March, SIAs are planned across Cairo to reach three million children with monovalent OPV type 1, to be followed in April by nationwide SIAs targeting 12 million children with trivalent OPV. A joint national and international team of epidemiologists and public health experts is assisting in the investigations, helping plan response activities and supporting active searches for any potential cases of paralytic polio. This event confirms ongoing international spread of a pathogen (WPV) slated for eradication. In May 2012, the completion of polio eradication was declared a programmatic emergency for global public health by the WHA in Resolution WHA65.5. Based on the history of previous importations to Egypt and the ongoing response, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of these virus strains from Egypt as moderate; and, of further international spread of WPV from Pakistan as high. In 2011, WPV from Pakistan spread internationally to China, causing an outbreak in the country’s western Xinjiang province, resulting in 21 cases. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-infected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is <> Egypt stopped transmission of indigenous WPV, with its last case in May 2004. The environmental samples which yielded these positive results were collected in December 2012.

A WPV1 case had been detected from Tahoua region, with onset of paralysis on 15 November 2012 (the first case in the country since December 2011). Genetic sequencing confirmed that the virus was a new importation into Niger, most closely related to virus circulating in Kaduna state, Nigeria. The Government of Niger is continuing to implement a comprehensive response in line with international outbreak response guidelines issued by the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Resolution WHA59.1. Following an initial supplementary immunization activity (SIA) on 15 January 2013 to reach approximately two million children with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), nationwide SIAs were conducted from 2-5 February 2013, targeting more than five million children with trivalent OPV. A second nationwide SIA is planned for 2-5 March with bivalent OPV. Previously, nationwide SIAs had been conducted on 23 November 2012 with bivalent OPV. A joint national and international team of epidemiologists and public health experts has been deployed by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa to assist the Government of Niger in the investigations, help plan response activities and support active searches for additional cases of paralytic polio. This event confirms the risk of ongoing international spread of a pathogen (WPV) slated for eradication. In May 2012, the completion of polio eradication was declared a programmatic emergency for global public health by the WHA in Resolution WHA65.5. Given the history of international spread of polio from northern Nigeria across west Africa, WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from Nigeria as high. Based on the history of previous importations to Niger and the ongoing response, WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from Niger as moderate to high. This risk is currently magnified by large-scale population movements across the region associated with insecurity in Mali. To minimize this risk, multi-country synchronized SIAs are planned across 13 countries of west Africa in late April and late May, using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV. Due to the persistence of subnational surveillance gaps in some areas of west Africa, undetected further circulation cannot be ruled out at this time.

Measures are being implemented to strengthen sub-national surveillance, to ensure that all groups and areas, particularly high-risk populations, are covered by high-quality surveillance.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms. Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented. People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation.

Conduct risk communication with the public and release information. WHO continues to closely monitor the H7N9 situation and conduct risk assessment. So far, the overall risk associated with the H7N9 virus has not changed. WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

Although investigations are ongoing to characterize the relation between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and the observed increase of microcephaly, information is being shared with Member States to raise awareness of the situation and to alert countries for similar events in their territories. For these reasons and to contribute to the knowledge of this event, PAHO/WHO urges Member States to report any increase of microcephaly or other neurological disorders in newborns that cannot be explained by known causes.

Since then, 2 additional cases have been reported in Saint Laurent du Maroni, French Guiana and in Fort de France, Martinique. The cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (viral genome detection) at the Pasteur Institute in Cayenne, French Guiana and at the university hospital laboratory in Martinique. Samples from 4 additional suspected cases in Martinique (1 in Lamentin and 3 in Le Robert) were sent to the National Reference Centre for arboviruses in Marseille for further analysis. In the French departments in the Caribbean, surveillance for local Zika virus infection is part of a global contingency plan that has been implemented since the summer of 2015 and suspected cases are notified to local health authorities. When cases are reported, local authorities implement active case finding and vector control measures around the residence of the reported case. In addition, local public health authorities have increased awareness among health professionals regarding Zika virus infection. The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women.

The patient reported having fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhoea since 26 December. He visited a public hospital in Hong Kong SAR, China on 27 December and was admitted to an isolation ward on 28 December. A sputum sample taken on 28 December tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA. The patient was in serious condition at the time of report. In Zhongshan, he passed by mobile stalls selling live poultry on 14 December but reported no direct contact with the poultry. In Hong Kong SAR, he purchased a chilled chicken from a shop near a wet market on 22 December but no live poultry was sold in the shop, and he did not enter the wet market. A total of 17 close contacts and 85 other contacts were identified as of 30 December, and put under medical surveillance. The patient’s co-traveller had a cough since 29 December and was admitted to a public hospital on the same day. His respiratory specimen tested negative for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA by the hospital. To date, a total of 809 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013. The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health has taken the following measures: Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel. Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation. Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely. Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact. WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals.

The district is outside the area known to be endemic area in Madagascar. No plague cases have been reported in this area since 1950. As of 27 December 2016, 62 cases (6 confirmed, 5 probable, 51 suspected) including 26 deaths (case fatality rate of 42%) have been reported in two adjacent districts in two neighbouring regions of the country. 28 cases, including 10 deaths have been reported from Befotaka District in Atsimo-Atsinanana Region and 34 cases including 16 deaths have been reported from Iakora district in Ihorombe Region. Of the 11 samples tested, 5 were positive for plague on rapid diagnostic test and 6 are now confirmed at Institut Pasteur laboratory. Of the total reported cases, 5 are classified as pneumonic plague cases and the remaining as bubonic plague. Retrospective investigations carried out in those two districts showed that it is possible that the outbreak might have started in mid-August 2016. The investigation in neighbouring villages is still ongoing. On 29 December, an investigation carried out within 25 km of the initial foci in Befotaka district has reported three deaths and is being investigated further for possible linkage to the outbreak. The affected zone is located in a very remote and hard to reach and highly insecure area (classified as red zone due to local banditry). Despite arrangements made with the local authorities, insecurity slows down the investigations and response activities. In addition, a helicopter has been made available but its use has been limited due to bad weather and financial limitations. On 6 December, a 15 member multidisciplinary team from MoH, Institute Pasteur including public health professional, epidemiologist, entomologist and laboratory professional visited the affected area for epidemiological investigation and response activities. Key response activities already implemented include: Epidemiological investigations including active case finding and rapid diagnostic testing Training of community health workers on community-based surveillance and early detection of cases Clinical Management of suspected cases Identification, follow up and chemoprophylaxis of contacts Vector and reservoir control through the use of Kartman boxes Sensitization of the population Strengthening the community based surveillance Free treatment of other diagnosed disease such as malaria Strengthening early detection in neighbouring districts Laboratory confirmation Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread appears unlikely, especially as it is occurring in very remote area. However, the difficulty to reach the affected area hampered prompt investigation and therefore at this stage the real magnitude of the outbreak is still to be defined and the risk of further spread in the area and sustained transmission cannot be formally ruled out. WHO continues supporting ongoing investigation and response activities. Further ecological investigations will be needed to understand the occurrence of a plague outbreak in an area which has not reported any cases of plague since 1950 in order to adapt long term surveillance and control measures. The outbreak impacts rural communities which have already suffered from remoteness and inadequate access to health services. Staff from MoH are supported by Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, who are all experienced on control measures. However, local conditions make their implementation complex.

On the same day, the Brazil IHR National Focal Point (NFP) informed PAHO/WHO that the 12 cases are male, residing in rural areas, and have an average age of approximately 37 years (range: 7–53 years). The first of these cases had onset of symptoms on 18 December 2016. Samples from the cases were sent to the State Reference Laboratory (the Ezequiel Dias Foundation) for differential diagnosis, including dengue, hantavirus, leptospirosis, malaria, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, and E). Results are pending. On 12 January, the Brazil IHR NFP provided an update on the event informing that a total of 110 suspected cases, including 30 deaths, had been reported from 15 municipalities of Minas Gerais: Ladainha (31 cases, 11 deaths), Caratinga (20 cases, 1 death), Imbe de Minas (14 cases, 1 death), Piedade de Caratinga (12 cases, 4 deaths), Poté (6 cases, 3 deaths), Ubaporanga (6 cases, 2 deaths), Itambacuri (5 cases, 3 deaths), Ipanema (4 cases, 1 death), Malacacheta (4 cases, 2 deaths), Entre Folhas (2 cases), Frei Gaspar (1 case), Inhapim (2 cases), São Domingos das Dores (1 case), São Sebastião do Maranhão (1 fatal case), and Setubinha (1 fatal case). Serological tests for 19 suspected cases were positive for yellow fever. Among them, 10 deaths (CFR: 53%) were reported. The report also confirms that there had been epizootics in 13 municipalities of Minas Gerais. Six of these 13 municipalities have not so far reported human cases of yellow fever: Agua Boa, Durande, Ipatinga, Sao Pedro do Sacui, Simonesia, and Teófilo Otoni. Health authorities at the federal, state, and municipal levels are implementing several measures to respond to the outbreak: The MoH has deployed technical teams to the state of Minas Gerais to assist the state and municipal secretary of health with surveillance and outbreak investigation, vector control, and coordination of health care services; A house-to-house immunization campaign is being conducted in the rural areas of affected municipalities; Preparedness activities are being conducted in states bordering Minas Gerais, for a potential introduction of yellow fever; The local press is working together with the MoH to keep the public constantly informed on the situation. Yellow fever outbreak has previously been detected in Minas Gerais. The most recent outbreak occurred in 2002–2003, when 63 confirmed cases, including 23 deaths (CFR: 37%), were detected. The current yellow fever outbreak is taking place in an area with relatively low vaccination coverage, which could favor the rapid spread of the disease. The concern is that transmission may extend to areas located in proximity of Minas Gerais, such as the state of Espírito Santo and the south of Bahia, which have favorable ecosystems for the transmission of the virus. These areas were previously considered to be at low risk of transmission and, consequently, yellow fever vaccination was not recommended. The introduction of the virus in these areas could potentially trigger large epidemics of yellow fever. There is also a risk that infected humans may travel to affected areas, within or outside of Brazil, where the Aedes mosquitoes are present and initiate local cycles of human-to-human transmission. Response efforts are further complicated by the fact that it is occurring in the context of concomitant outbreaks of Zika virus, chikungunya and dengue. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. WHO, therefore, urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas. WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Brazil based on the current information available.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["yellow fever"], "syndromes": ["Fever of unknown Origin"], "event_date": "2016-12-18 xx:xx:xx to 2017-01-12 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Rio de Janeiro", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Minas Gerais", "city": "Malacacheta"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Florida", "city": "Lakeland"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Goiás", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "São Paulo", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Sergipe", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of São Paulo", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Colorado", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Espírito Santo", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "Distrito Federal", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Minas Gerais", "city": "Teófilo Otoni"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "New York", "city": "New York"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Minas Gerais", "city": "Simonésia"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Rio Grande do Sul", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Minas Gerais", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of São Paulo", "city": "São Sebastião"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Bahia", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "Minas Gerais", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Maranhão", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Missouri", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "New York", "city": null}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "Minas Gerais", "city": "Entre Folhas"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Mato Grosso", "city": "Água Boa"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "State of Minas Gerais", "city": "Ubaporanga"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "Minas Gerais", "city": "Frei Gaspar"}, {"continent": "South America", "country": "Brazil", "state": "Minas Gerais", "city": "Setubinha"}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2017-mers-saudi-arabia/en/", "date_of_publication": "2017-01-17", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) – Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "Between 16 and 31 December 2016 the national IHR focal point of Saudi Arabia reported fifteen (15) additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) including two (2) fatal cases.

Ministry of Agriculture has been informed and investigation of camels is ongoing. The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 5 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in previous DONs published on 28 November (case no. 2), 19 December (1) (case no. 6), and 19 December (2) (case no. 1, 2, and 9). Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. Globally, since September 2012, 1879 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 666 related deaths have been reported to WHO. MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["mers-cov"], "syndromes": ["Acute respiratory syndrome"], "event_date": "2016-11-28 xx:xx:xx to 2016-12-31 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Al Madinah Province", "city": "Medina"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Al Madinah Province", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Makkah Province", "city": "Taif"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "Dubai", "city": "Dubai"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "دبي", "city": "دبي"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Najran", "city": "Najran"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "California", "city": "Fremont"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "مكة المكرمة", "city": "الخرمة"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Najran", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "Canada", "state": "Ontario", "city": "Toronto"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Lebanon", "state": "Mount Lebanon Governorate", "city": "Hadath"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Michigan", "city": "Birmingham"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Riyadh Province", "city": "Riyadh"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Makkah Province", "city": "Mecca"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Riyadh Province", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Al Madinah Province", "city": "Mahd Al Thahab"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Makkah Province", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Aseer Province", "city": "Abha"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": "Aseer Province", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "Dubai", "city": "Dubai"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "Abu Dhabi", "city": "Abu Dhabi"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "دبي", "city": "دبي"}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2017-ah7n9-china/en/", "date_of_publication": "2017-01-17", "headline": "Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus – China", "main_text": "On 5 January 2017, the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of a case of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and on 9 January 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 106 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. On 5 January 2017, a human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) was reported from the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). The case is a 62-year-old man with underlying illnesses, who travelled to Zengcheng, Guangzhou on 15 December 2016. He developed influenza-like symptoms on 1 January 2017 while he was in Guangzhou. He was admitted to a hospital in Dongguan on 2 January 2017 and returned to Hong Kong SAR on 3 January 2017, where he was admitted to hospital on 4 January 2017 for further treatment. His condition deteriorated and he was transferred to an intensive care unit for further management. He passed away on 6 January 2017. His samples tested positive for A(H7N9) by RT-PCR on 5 January 2017. The patient reported no recent exposure to poultry or live poultry markets. Contact tracing is underway. On 9 January 2017, 106 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) were reported from the NHFPC. The onset dates ranged from 22 November 2016 to 29 December 2016. Of these 106 cases, 36 are female. The median age is 54 years (age range among the cases is 23 to 91 years old). The cases are reported from Jiangsu (52), Zhejiang (21), Anhui (14), Guangdong (14), Shanghai (2), Fujian (2) and Hunan (1). At the time of notification, there were 35 deaths and 57 severe cases. Eighty of the cases are reported to have had exposure to poultry or a live poultry market. Two clusters were reported. First cluster: A 66-year-old male from Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. He had symptom onset on 25 November 2016, was admitted to hospital on 28 November 2016 and died on 12 December 2016. He was exposed to a live poultry market. A 39-year-old female from Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. She had symptom onset on 8 December 2016 and was admitted to hospital on the same day. She is the daughter of the 66-year old male. At the time of report, she was suffering from severe pneumonia. Human-to-human transmission between the 66-year-old male and the 39-year-old female cannot be ruled out. Second cluster: A 66-year-old male from Hefei city, Anhui province. He had symptom onset on 16 December 2016, and was admitted to hospital on 17 December 2016 and died on 20 December 2016. He was exposed to a live poultry market. A 62-year-old male from Hefei city, Anhui province. He had symptom onset on 22 December 2016. He was admitted in the same ward as the 66-year old male. His current condition is severe. Human-to-human transmission between the 66-year-old male and the 62-year-old male cannot be ruled out. To date, a total of 916 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013. Considering the increase of laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) in December 2016, the Chinese government has enhanced measures: NHFPC strengthened epidemic surveillance, conducted timely risk assessment and studies for any changes in epidemiology. NHFPC requested local NHFPCs to implement effective control measures on the source of outbreaks and to minimize the number of affected people. Strengthened early diagnosis and early treatment, treatment of severe cases, and reduce occurrence of severe cases and deaths. Further enhanced medical treatment. Joint investigations between NHFPC and Ministries of agriculture, industry and commerce visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong provinces where more cases occurred for joint supervision, inspection and guidance on local surveillance, medical treatment, prevention and control and to promote control measures with focus on live poultry market management and cross-regional transportation. Relevant prefectures in Jiangsu province have closed live poultry markets in late December 2016 and Zhejiang, Guangdong and Anhui provinces have strengthened live poultry market regulations. Conducting public risk communication and sharing information with the public. The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR has taken the following measures: Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel. Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation. Similar sudden increases in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection have been observed in previous years during this period of time (December-January). Nevertheless close monitoring of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to make timely adjustments to risk management measures. Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Based on available information we have, further community level spread is considered unlikely. Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and because there is the potential for significant public health impact, it needs to be monitored closely. WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["influenza a/h7n9"], "syndromes": ["Influenza-like illness"], "event_date": "2016-11-25 xx:xx:xx to 2017-01-09 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Anhui", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Guangdong Province", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Guangdong Province", "city": "Guangzhou"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Xinjiang", "city": "Ili"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Maryland", "city": "Upper Marlboro"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Zhejiang Sheng", "city": "Hangzhou Shi"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Jiangsu", "city": "Suzhou"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Anhui", "city": "Hefei"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Hunan", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Beijing Shi", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Hebei Sheng", "city": "Tangshan Shi"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": "Hong Kong Island", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Zhejiang", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": "Kowloon", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Shanghai", "city": "Shanghai"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Pennsylvania", "city": "Mechanicsburg"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "North Carolina", "city": "Indian Trail"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Guangdong Province", "city": "Dongguan"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Kansas", "city": "Independence"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Liaoning Sheng", "city": "Shenyang Shi"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Massachusetts", "city": "Danvers"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Jiangsu", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Fujian", "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/18-january-2017-ah7n9-china/en/", "date_of_publication": "2017-01-18", "headline": "Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus – China", "main_text": "On 11 January 2017, the Department of Health, China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of a laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and on 12 January 2017, the Health Bureau, China, Macao SAR notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Another nasopharyngeal aspirate taken on 11 January 2017 was later further confirmed as positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus on 11 January 2017. The patient visited a relative’s home in Foshan, Guangdong with backyard chickens between 31 December 2016 and 3 January 2017, but reported no direct contact with these chickens. The family visited a market while in Guangdong but reported no entry to the poultry section. As of 11 January 2017, 27 close contacts and 70 other contacts have been identified as contacts of the 10-year-old boy. Among four symptomatic other contacts, two have tested negative for influenza A, while the other two are pending testing. Remaining contacts have remained asymptomatic and are under medical surveillance. On 12 January 2017, a human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) was reported from the Health Bureau, China, Macao SAR. The case is a 72-year-old female who lives in Zhongshan, Guangdong, a city close to China, Macao SAR. She had exposure to chickens at her home and often goes to a live poultry market near her house. On 8 January 2017, she developed symptoms and was admitted to a hospital in Zhongshan. She left the hospital in Zhongshan on 9 January 2017 and travelled to China, Macao SAR where she was admitted to the government hospital on 10 January 2017 with the diagnosis of pneumonia. Specimens collected on 10 January 2017 tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) by RT-PCR on 12 January 2017. The patient was referred to an isolation ward. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. She is currently in stable condition. As of 12 January 2017, three relatives, four ambulance workers, four hospital roommates and 32 medical workers were identified as close contacts to the 72-year-old female. They are receiving antiviral treatment for five days and are under medical observation for the next 10 days. To date, a total of 918 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013. The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health in China, Hong Kong SAR has taken the following measures: Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel. Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation. Authorities in China, Macao SAR have taken the following measures: Conducted a risk assessment. Management of the case and observation of close contacts. Communicated with authorities in mainland China to follow-up on the family and medical staff. Held a press conference to share information on the situation and response. Urged the public to avoid contact with live poultry. Increases in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection have been observed in previous years during this period of time (December-January). Nevertheless close monitoring of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to make timely adjustments to risk management measures. Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Based on available information we have, further community level spread is considered unlikely. Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and because there is the potential for significant public health impact, it needs to be monitored closely. WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["influenza a/h7n9"], "syndromes": ["Influenza-like illness"], "event_date": "2016-12-31 xx:xx:xx to 2017-01-12 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Maryland", "city": "Upper Marlboro"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Guangdong Province", "city": "Zhongshan"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Guangdong Province", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": "Hong Kong Island", "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Kansas", "city": "Independence"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Guangdong Province", "city": "Foshan"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Hong Kong", "state": "Kowloon", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Xinjiang", "city": "Ili"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "China", "state": "Beijing Shi", "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Macao", "state": null, "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-january-2017-hepatitis-e-chad/en/", "date_of_publication": "2017-01-24", "headline": "Hepatitis E – Chad", "main_text": "From 1 September 2016 until 13 January 2017, a total of 693 cases including 11 deaths of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) have been reported from Am Timan, Chad. Of the 50 patients with AJS who were hospitalized, 48 were tested for Hepatitis E using the Hepatitis E virus rapid diagnostic test (HEV RDT) and 27 (56.3%) tested positive. In total, at the end of epidemiological week 2, 2017, a total of 126 HEV RDT have been performed, of them 57 (45.2%) were positive, while 69 (54.8%) tested negative for Hepatitis E. 18 (31.6%) of the 57 patients that tested positive using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test, and 20 (29%) out of 69 patients that tested negative using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test. Since September 2016, 11 deaths have been reported among the hospitalized cases but the total case fatality might be underestimated. As of 13 January 2017, 16 pregnant women presenting with AJS have been hospitalized and tested for Hepatitis E, 12 (75%) of them tested positive using the HEV RDT. Of the pregnant women presenting with AJS, four have reportedly died (three had tested positive for Hepatitis E). Approximately 90% of the AJS cases were reported from Am Timan which appears to be the epi-centre of the ongoing outbreak, and most of the cases are identified through active case findings. As of 13 January 2017, AJS cases have been reported from 59 different quartiers in and surrounding Am Timan. The outbreak was detected when two pregnant icteric women were admitted in the Am Timan Regional Hospital, partly supported by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) since 2009. MSF has been responding to the outbreak in support to the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) with a total of 14 expatriate staff and over 400 national staff dedicated to the epidemic response in addition to staff involved in the regular project. MSF provides support in implementing outbreak monitoring, active surveillance, water chlorination and community sensitization in Am Timan.* In addition, World Health Organization (WHO) and the MPH are complementing the initial investigations carried out between 22–29 October 2016 by extending investigations to the whole region in order to identify potential new foci.*** Based on the available information, there appears to be a plateau in the number of cases reported in the past 5 weeks from the affected area with an average of 70 cases reported weekly where only a minor proportion (7.2%) requires hospitalization. The infectious risk seems confined to Am Timan and immediate surroundings. However, the event remains under close monitoring at all levels of WHO. The current level of risk for further spread remains as moderate to high and at local level, and the limited capacity to respond to date calls for additional immediate support, especially in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilisation. WHO recommends the continuation of the investigations with a specific case definition as to describe the time, place and person characteristics of the outbreak and identify the source. It is important to identify the source of contamination of the surface water and, in the meantime, to ensure water safety by chlorination at the point of use by the population. Travellers to Chad should follow standard hygiene recommendations in terms of water and food safety for travellers.

Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below). The five cases from Buridah reported are part of a small health care setting outbreak involving 2 hospitals. A Ministry of Health rapid response team has been dispatched and measures to prevent further cases including contact tracing, and strengthening of infection, prevention and control have been put in place. None of the cases reported are health care workers. Globally, since September 2012, 1888 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 670 related deaths have been reported to WHO. MERS-CoV cases reported between 2 and 7 January 2017xlsx, 14kb MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

The geographical distribution of confirmed yellow fever human cases is expanding and includes, in addition to Minas Gerais State, the States of Espírito Santo and São Paulo. In addition, Bahia State reported 6 yellow fever human cases under investigation. Espírito Santo State, an area that was previously not considered at risk for yellow fever, confirmed its first autochthonous human case of yellow fever since 1940. The case is a 44-year-old male from the municipality of Ibatiba. São Paulo State, reported three laboratory-confirmed cases of human yellow fever, all of whom died. In Minas Gerais State, as of 24 January, a total of 404 cases (66 confirmed, 337 suspected and 1 discarded), including 84 deaths (37 among confirmed cases and 47 among suspected with a case fatality rate of 56% and 14%, respectively) were reported. The total number of suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases reported is the highest reported nationwide since 2000. Among the 66 confirmed cases from Minas Gerais State, 88% are male and 45% have not been vaccinated against yellow fever (the vaccination status of the remaining 55% is unknown or not available). Additionally, a large number of epizootics among non-human primates (NHP) were reported in the States of São Paulo (247 epizootics, including 3 confirmed for yellow fever) and Espírito Santo (367 epizootics). In Espírito Santo State, epizootics have been confirmed for yellow fever in Irupia and Colatina municipalities. Brazilian health authorities, at the federal, state, and municipal levels, are implementing several measures to respond to the outbreak, including: In addition to the 650,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine distributed across the country as part of the routine supply of the National Vaccination Calendar in January 2017, the Ministry of Health of Brazil has sent 4.2 million doses of yellow fever vaccines to the States of Bahia (400,000), Espírito Santo (1 million), Minas Gerais (2.4 million), and Rio de Janeiro (350,000). Vector control activities to eliminate Aedes aegypti breeding sites in affected municipalities have started. A Situation Room has been established in the affected states and at the national level. A web portal was launched by the Ministry of Health to inform the public about the situation and provide guidance. The increase in the number of yellow fever cases in the State of Minas Gerais, the confirmation of cases in two new states, alongside the occurrence of epizootics in the states reporting human cases, highlights the geographical spread of the outbreak to new areas. At this stage, there is no evidence that Aedes aegypti is implicated in the transmission in the current outbreak. However, the risk of urban transmission of yellow fever cannot be ruled out. It is expected that additional cases will be detected in other states in Brazil given the internal movement of people and infected monkeys and the low level of vaccination coverage in areas that were previously not considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission. There is also a risk that infected individuals may travel to areas, within or outside of Brazil, where the Aedes mosquitoes are present and initiate local cycles of human-to-human transmission. At present, there are no yellow fever cases reported in the neighbouring countries associated with this current outbreak. The current outbreak and upsurge of yellow fever activity in Brazil extends beyond those areas considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission as presented in the WHO publication “International Travel and Health, 2016”, while national authorities are taking appropriate steps to contain this epidemic, yellow fever vaccination recommendations for travellers need to be updated.

Areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil, 2013–2017png, 977kb This determination of new areas deemed to be at risk for yellow fever transmission represents the first preliminary and precautionary step of a dynamic risk assessment process. Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil includes vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel; observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites, awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the competent vector for yellow fever transmission is present. As per Annex 7 of the IHR a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine are not needed. If, on medical ground, a traveler cannot be vaccinated against yellow fever, this must be certified by the relevant authorities as per Annex 6 and Annex 7 of the IHR.

For detailed information, click the link below. The case, a 55 year old male who resides in Malaysia, traveled as a member of a pilgrimage group to KSA from 13-23 December 2017. The case reported a history of exposure to dromedary camels (drinking unpasteurized camel milk and direct contact with a camel) while visiting a camel farm in Riyadh on 20 December 2017. The case developed symptoms on 24 December, was treated and hospitalized in Malaysia. Currently the case is asymptomatic and in hospital. The Ministry of Health is closely monitoring 70 individuals who have had close contact with the case, which include family members, Umrah pilgrims from the same pilgrimage as the case, healthcare professionals in the healthcare facilities and other close airline contacts. As of 5 January, no further cases have been identified in Malaysia. Of the 70 contacts identified and followed by the Malaysian Ministry of Health, 61 contacts have had no symptoms. Nine contacts had mild symptoms and were admitted to an isolation ward. Samples from the 9 symptomatic contacts were negative for MERS-CoV, and, subsequently, they were discharged from hospital. Forty-one asymptomatic close contacts were placed under home surveillance for 14 days from the last day of contact with the 55 year old laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case. Out of these 41 asymptomatic close contacts, 22 tested negative for MERS-CoV while tests are still pending for the remaining 19 contacts. This is the second case of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV reported from Malaysia. The previous imported case was reported in Malaysia in 2014. Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 2,123 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV in 27 countries, including at least 740 deaths. The Ministry of Health has taken the following prevention and control measures:   Identification of all contacts of the laboratory confirmed case (as described above). Symptomatic contacts were placed in isolation in hospital and tested for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. Asymptomatic contacts were placed under home isolation and monitored for 14 days following last contact with the laboratory confirmed case. Further strengthening of surveillance of ‘Influenza-like Illness’ (ILI) and ‘Severe Acute Respiratory Infection’ (SARI) throughout Malaysia, particularly among returning pilgrims from KSA. Intensifying alertness and case management of patients under investigation for MERS-CoV in all health facilities. Enhancement of infection prevention and control measures at all health care facilities. Reinforcement to the Ministry of Tourism, Department of Islamic Development Malaysia and Malaysian Hajj Pilgrims Fund Board on advice to tour agencies offering Hajj packages to take necessary precautions to prevent pilgrims from being exposed to MERS-CoV while travelling to the Middle East. The Ministry of Health in KSA is investigating the source of infection of the confirmed case while he was KSA. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings. The notification of additional cases does not change WHO’s overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a healthcare setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts the risk assessment based on the latest available information.   Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Community and household awareness of MERS and MERS prevention measures in the home may reduce household transmission and prevent community clusters. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barns in areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. Countries should advise travellers on how to prevent infection with MERS-CoV while travelling to affected areas.

Tanzania mainland has reported 86% of the total cases in this outbreak. Children under five years old accounted for 11.4% of cases. Since the beginning of the outbreak over 7000 specimens have been tested for cholera and 47% were positive for Vibrio cholerae by culture. From 1 January 2017 through 31 December, 4985 cases including 99 deaths have been reported in Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar. The number of cases as well as geographical spread of cholera has markedly reduced compared to the two previous years. During the same period in 2016, 14 547 cases and 225 deaths were reported for Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar. In 2017, the highest number of cases was reported from Mbeya Region during week 31 (week starting 31 July 2017) and from Songwe Region during week 43 (week starting 23 October 2017). Between weeks 49-52, Uvinza, Songwe and Nyasa districts reported the highest number of cases. The resurgence of cases in Kigoma, Manyara, Dodoma, Mbeya and Dar es Salaam regions, and Ruvuma and Rukwa regions reporting cases for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak reflects the persisting risk for a cholera upsurge in many other regions. Zanzibar has reported no cases since the last case was reported on 11 July 2017, however high population movement to and from Tanzania Mainland still poses a risk of spread to Zanzibar. Figure 1: Number of cholera cases in Tanzania mainland reported by week of illness onset from 1 January through 7 January between 2015-2018. The following public health measures are currently being implemented: The Ministry of Health (MoH) is collaborating with WHO and other partners (UNICEF and the United States Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) to implement and monitor cholera control activities through the National Task Force. On 15 December 2017, the National Cholera Response Plan has been reviewed and validated by the MoH and stakeholders. Cholera National Task Force meeting was conducted on Friday 29 December 2017 and agreed to deploy a team to assist Uvinza District to respond to the acute upsurge of cholera cases. The MoH deployed a national rapid response team to Ruvuma Region which reported cases for the first time at the end of November 2017. Community sensitization and awareness through local radio, television and social media is ongoing. UNICEF is supporting the promotion and distribution of aqua tabs for household level water treatment and safe storage in the affected households. Zanzibar is progressing to develop a ten year cholera elimination plan. Initiation of exchanges for reinforcing the cross-border preparedness and response actions. Active cholera transmission has persisted in Tanzania Mainland, with Mbeya and Songwe Regions being the most active. The country remains vulnerable to the late detection of cholera due to the weak surveillance systems. The WASH activities, case management, community engagement, and surveillance pillars still require strengthening for optimal outbreak response and, if not addressed, further upsurge of cases may be observed throughout the country. The risk at national level is therefore high. The closure of the fishing camps along Lake Rukwa on the Songwe Region border, forced the fishermen to move further south to Kyela district which borders Malawi’s Karonga district. Malawi recently reported a cholera outbreak in Karonga. Cross-border population movement between the two countries might further increase the risk of transmission in Malawi. Other neighbouring countries such as DRC, Burundi, Zambia and Kenya are already experiencing large cholera outbreaks. The risk at regional level is high. WHO recommends proper and timely case management in Cholera Treatment Centres. Improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities, are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar based on the information available on the current outbreak.

During the week ending on 8 January 2018, a total of 237 probable and confirmed cases have been seen at various health facilities in Windhoek district with the same signs and symptoms. All suspected patients tested negative for hepatitis A, B, and C. A total of 41 of the 237 cases were sent for further testing, and on 8 January 2018, the results showed 21 were IgM positive for hepatitis E. On 19 November 2017, there was one confirmed deceased case, a 26 year-old female, and four days prior to her death she had delivered a baby. The status of the baby is unknown. The majority of the cases were from Windhoek district, Khomas region. Figure 1: The number of patients seen with acute clinical jaundice in Windhoek district by week, from September 2017 to 8 January 2018 (n = 237) On 14 December 2017, the national, regional, and district Health Emergency Management Committees were activated and the government of the city of Windhoek was informed of the outbreak. Five different working groups have been formed to strengthen coordination and plan response activities under the following thematic areas; surveillance and laboratory, case management, coordination and logistics, WASH, environmental health, and social mobilization. On 20 December 2017, the Minister of Health held a media briefing to educate the public about the outbreak with the participation of WHO and partners. The Ministry of Health is currently leading the case management teams and all suspected cases have been referred to hospitals for treatment. To further strengthen surveillance and laboratory response activities, data collection and reporting tools have been distributed to health facilities. Case reporting and investigation, and line listing of cases have been enhanced. An environmental health team from the Ministry of Health and Social Services and the City of Windhoek are currently conducting environmental investigations to identify exposures that led to the outbreak. A national radio campaign to sensitize the affected communities to the risk of hepatitis E is ongoing as well as regular briefings of the public regarding the outbreak. The city of Windhoek has tested the water quality of the affected area and continues to monitor routinely. The Ministry of Health has deployed a field epidemiologist to support the community engagement teams to ensure active case search and coordinated targeting of areas with active transmission. Beginning on 23 December 2017, orientations have been conducted to train Red Cross volunteers and community health workers to implement community sensitization and mobilization activities in areas at high risk of hepatitis E. On 31 December 2017 a community engagement exercise was done to empower community leaders. The aim was to increase leaders’ awareness of disease prevention measures and also develop culturally acceptable interventions to change behavior and practices which were contributing to the spread of the disease in the community. Community leaders and health extension workers were also oriented to educate the community on early care seeking for individuals having signs and symptoms compatible with hepatitis E. Although hepatitis A, B, and C are common in Namibia, hepatitis E is rarely diagnosed in the country. As a result, the country has limited capacity for hepatitis E laboratory diagnosis. Additionally, the majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported from informal settlements within the capital district, Windhoek, where living conditions are poor. These areas are overcrowded, and have limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. Moreover, the holiday season will likely increase the movement of people within the country. All of these could be major contributing factors to this outbreak. Additionally, during the rainy season, people often use rainwater or other surface water for drinking and domestic uses. This likely increases the risk of hepatitis E infection. Therefore, the above-mentioned factors might lead to the propagation of the cases from this area to other informal settlements and its distribution to other towns or districts, with similar poor environmental health conditions. Thus, the overall risk is assessed as high at the national level and low at regional and global levels. WHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and proper sanitation through different methods, including at-home water purification techniques. The water quality should be regularly monitored in the affected areas. The number of latrines in different settlements should be increased to address the issue of open defecation. In addition, the waste management and the overall hygiene practices should be improved. Furthermore, the ongoing interventions should target at-risk population through the establishment of antenatal counseling for pregnant women, improving housing conditions for those living in these informal settlements and supporting the improvement of health facilities and patients care. The local and national reference laboratory capacities should be improved for timely confirmation of suspected cases. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Namibia on the basis of the information available on the current event. The implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2017-09-xx xx:xx:xx to 2018-01-08 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "Africa", "country": "Namibia", "state": "Kavango Region", "city": "Rundu"}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Namibia", "state": "Khomas Region", "city": "Windhoek"}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Namibia", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Namibia", "state": "Omaheke Region", "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Namibia", "state": "Khomas Region", "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/22-january-2018-yellow-fever-brazil/en/", "date_of_publication": "2018-01-22", "headline": "Yellow fever – Brazil", "main_text": "From 1 July 2017 through 14 January 2018, 35 confirmed human cases of yellow fever were reported in Brazil (Figure 1), including 20 deaths and 145 suspected cases who are under investigation. In recent weeks, the number of confirmed human cases of yellow fever has tripled in Brazil, mainly in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Confirmed cases were notified in the states of São Paulo (20 cases, including 11 deaths), Rio de Janeiro (three cases, including one death), and Minas Gerais (11 cases, including seven deaths), and in the Federal District (one fatal case). All confirmed cases are likely to have acquired their infections in geographic locations where there are documented epizootics in non-human primates. In Minas Gerais cases are reported in municipalities where no human cases were detected during the outbreak in 2016/2017. In São Paulo, the highest proportion of cases is reported in Maripora, an area located 15 kilometers from the northern area of the municipality of São Paulo. The new cases in Rio de Janeiro are reported in the municipalities of Valença and Teresópolis; the latter is located 96 kilometers from the city of Rio de Janeiro. On 11 January 2018, a case of yellow fever was confirmed in The Netherlands (PCR positive) in a returning traveller with history of stay in the municipality of Mairipora and Atibaia, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 19 December 2017 through 8 January 2018, an area where the circulation of yellow fever virus is currently occurring. The case has no history of yellow fever vaccination. The onset of illness was 7 January 2018, when the patient reported symptoms of high fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Although epizootics have been reported throughout 2017, there was a significant increase from September 2017. The high number of epizootics and animals concerned indicates a high level of circulation of the virus in ecosystems favorable for transmission. From 1 July 2017 through 14 January 2018, there were 2442 epizootics in non-human primates reported in 21 federal entities, including areas that were previously not considered to be at risk for yellow fever. Of these, 411 were laboratory-confirmed, 747 are under investigation, 817 were classified as indeterminate and 467 were ruled-out. The confirmed epizootics for yellow fever were reported by four states (Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo); however, the majority (88%) of the confirmed epizootics were registered in the state of São Paulo. Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed yellow fever human cases by epidemiological week, Brazil, from 1 January 2016 through 14 January 2018 Since September 2017, when yellow fever was confirmed in human cases and epizootics in São Paulo, national authorities have been intensifying vaccination activities through routine and preemptive immunization campaigns. In addition, state and municipality health authorities have been strengthening healthcare services for management of cases and have been carrying out risk communication. In early January 2018, to reduce the risk of a large yellow fever outbreak, the Brazilian Ministry of Health announced plans to conduct a mass yellow fever vaccination campaigns which will include both standard (0.5 mL) and fractional (0.1 mL) doses. The campaigns will take place in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, from 25 January through 17 February and in Bahia, from 19 February through 3 March. The aim is to vaccinate 21.8 million people (16.5 million with the fractionated dose and 5.3 million with the standard dose) who live in 77 municipalities in these three states. The number of epizootics reported since July 2017 continues to be a concern, especially near urban areas of large cities, such as São Paulo, and in municipalities that were previously not considered at risk for yellow fever. While measures implemented by the Brazilian authorities during the 2016/2017 outbreak have contributed to the occurrence of a smaller number of cases when comparing the periods from 28 November 2016 through 15 January 2017 with 27 November 2017 through 14 January 2018. The large number of unvaccinated people who continue to live in areas with ecosystems favorable for transmission of the yellow fever virus represent a elevated risk for the change in the current transmission pattern. It is expected that the decision of the Brazilian authorities to carry out a mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever, including standard (0.5 ml) and fractional (0.1 ml) doses, can effectively limit the transmission of yellow fever. It is important to note that, due to its scale and scope, this mass vaccination campaign will likely be characterized by significant logistical challenges. The recent occurrence of a confirmed yellow fever case in an unvaccinated traveller reveals the need for States Parties to reinforce the dissemination of recommendations for international travellers. The current WHO recommendations for international travellers going to Brazil were updated on 16 January 2018 and are available at the link below: WHO recommendations for travellers, Brazil Travellers returning with viraemia may pose a risk to the establishment of local yellow fever transmission cycles predominantly in areas where the vector is present. To date, there has been no evidence of yellow fever transmission by Aedes aegypti. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016/2017 outbreak in some of the affected states, it was found that the isolated Haemagogus mosquitoes were positive for yellow fever. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.

From 14 August 2017 through 11 February 2018, 1799 cases and one death (case fatality rate = 0.06%) of cholera were reported from the two provinces; Nampula (1580 cases) and Cabo Delgado (219 cases). Underreporting of the number of cases and deaths is likely. This outbreak has been confirmed by Rapid Diagnostic Tests and culture. The outbreak started in Memba district in the north-eastern province Nampula and spread to Erati district by 15 October 2017. By 19 November, the outbreak had spread to two further districts in the same province (Nacaroa and Nampula city). Case incidence peaked in mid-November with 252 cases reported in one week; this peak was followed by a rapid decrease in reported cases (figure 1). A slow increase in the number of cases reported has been observed since late December 2017. On 5 January 2018, the first cases were reported from Pemba City in Cabo Delgado Province which is north of Nampula. In 2018 so far, the weekly number of cases have fluctuated between 30 and 60 cases. Cholera outbreaks have occurred in Mozambique every year for the past five years. The most recent outbreak prior to the current outbreak started in January 2017 and ended in April 2017, and resulted in a total of 2129 cases and four deaths (case fatality rate= 0.2%). Three provinces and six districts were affected in the 2017 outbreak (Tete, Nampula, and Maputo province). WHO and partners are supporting response activities to contain the outbreak. The following response measures are ongoing: The Ministry of Health is leading a weekly coordination meeting at the national level to discuss the ongoing response. Partners including WHO, UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and the Red Cross attend and support the meeting. Multi-sectoral coordination particularly at the district level; coordinating response actions between the different sectors and it is led by district officials. WHO has conducted a rapid assessment of the situation in Nampula province and has shared the findings at the national coordination meeting. WHO has supported training on case management and surveillance in Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces to improve case management, case detection, and reporting. With support from UNICEF, national and local health authorities have provided logistical support to set up and supply cholera treatment centers with consumable, medication, and infection prevention and control supplies. Cholera treatment centers have been set up in each of the affected districts. There are efforts to improve water quality, sanitation conditions, and hygiene practices in the affected districts are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities and water supply sector with the support of partners. Social mobilization and risk communication activities are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities with the support of partners. Risk factors contributing to the propagation of cholera to other provinces and districts in this outbreak include a shortage of potable water and contamination of household drinking water, which emphasize the need to improve access to clean water, adequate hygiene, and sanitation. The three provinces which have reported cholera cases in this outbreak have been severely affected by the flooding which has resulted in the displacement of people and damage to the infrastructure, including health facilities. The meteorological forecast indicates that this heavy rainfall will continue for the next three months which may contribute to the potential spread of the outbreak. It is not possible to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, as no epidemiological or environmental investigations have been conducted in the two affected provinces and disease risk factors are unknown. Priorities at this stage are to strengthen the surveillance system, and harmonizing cholera data collection and line listing of the cases, as well as putting in place a mechanism for active case finding at the community level. In addition, the cholera case definition should be strictly applied to all suspected cases to decrease underreporting and to improve case detection in this outbreak. Other response activities such as case management, implementation of WASH interventions and social mobilization also need to be strengthened at the national, provincial, district and community levels. The overall risk is assessed as high at the national level; this assessment is partially due to the lack of information regarding the current outbreak dynamics and response actions. The risk is assessed to be low at the regional and global levels. WHO recommends improving access to safe water, sanitation capacities, and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to case management should be improved in the affected areas. National capacity to rapidly detect and respond is needed if the outbreak spreads to other areas. The provision of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread of the outbreak should also be considered. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Mozambique based on the information available. The use of safe drinking water and the implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.

The patient was treated with Ribavirin until her death on 11 January 2018. The patient first experienced symptoms on 29 December 2017. Prior to hospitalization in Liberia, she sought medical care at a health facility in Diécké in N'Zérékore Region, Guinea where she was treated for typhoid and malaria. On 10 January 2018, a specimen was collected and tested positive for Lassa fever by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Reference Laboratory in Liberia. On 11 January, a safe and dignified burial was conducted for the patient in Ganta. In Liberia, as of 18 January, 28 contacts were identified, including 16 from the Ganta Hospital and 12 family members. In Guinea, 28 contacts, including 22 health care workers, were identified. As of 18 January 2018, two of the patient’s contacts in Liberia were symptomatic, but both tested negative for Lassa fever by RT-PCR. The other contacts have now all completed their follow-up period. Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia. From 1 January 2017 through 23 January 2018, 91 suspected cases were reported from six counties: Bong, Grand Bassa, Grand Kru, Lofa, Margibi, and Nimba. Thirty-three of these cases were laboratory confirmed, including 15 deaths (case fatality rate for confirmed cases = 45.4%). In Liberia, the Nimba County Surveillance Officer was responsible for coordinating the response to this event. A rapid response team was deployed to Ganta, Liberia and an investigation mission took place in Diécké, Guinea. A cross-border epidemiological investigation also took place. In Guinea, an in-depth investigation has been conducted by an epidemiologist, infectious disease doctor and laboratory technicians. Surveillance has been enhanced at the district and county levels. Contact tracing and active case finding has been conducted in both countries. A total of 27 blood samples from 24 contacts and three febrile patients in Diecké Primary Healthcare Center, Guinea were collected. Infection control measures were reinforced in Diécké's public and private health care facilities. Infographics on Lassa fever have been made available in Diécké public and private health care facilities and at points of entry. Community engagement and sensitization activities have taken place in Nimba County, Liberia and Diécké, Guinea to increase awareness about the risks and prevention of Lassa fever. Due to potential cross-border disease transmission, the WHO country offices of Liberia and Guinea have been collaborating to share information with each other about this event. Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. Overall, the case fatality rate is approximately 1%; however, it can be 15% or more among patients hospitalized with severe symptoms. Early treatment and rehydration improves the chance of survival. Lassa fever causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of Liberia and West Africa. The trend in the number of Lassa fever cases reported per week in Liberia has remained stable from January 2017 through 18 February 2018. Public health actions should be focused on preparedness in Liberia and areas of Guinea which border Nimba County. Active case finding, contact tracing, laboratory support and risk communication activities should continue. Although there is significant population movement between Liberian states and across the border of Nimba County with Guinea, neither large-scale disease transmission nor outbreaks in Guinea have been reported. Prevention of Lassa fever is reliant on promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic can export the disease to other countries, although this rarely occurs. The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have been in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is endemic. Health care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing.

This is the first human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) infection to be reported worldwide. The case-patient was a 68-year-old woman from Jiangsu Province with pre-existing coronary heart disease and hypertension and she developed symptoms on 25 December 2017. Seven days later, she was admitted to a local hospital for treatment of severe pneumonia and was discharged after 21 days. On 12 February, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) confirmed that the case-patient’s samples were positive for avian influenza A(H7N4). The NHFPC confirmed the diagnosis on 13 February 2018. The case-patient had reported a history of exposure to live poultry before onset of symptoms. Genetic sequencing of this A(H7N4) virus shows that all the virus segments originated from avian influenza viruses. This virus is sensitive to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors based on genetic sequencing. Twenty-eight close contacts of the case-patient have been under medical observation. Among close contacts, no abnormal findings have been found and all throat swabs from her contacts have tested negative. The Chinese government conducted a risk assessment, and has enhanced prevention and control measures, surveillance and epidemiological investigations including contact tracing and laboratory testing. Public risk communication and information sharing is ongoing. WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. WHO is facilitating information-sharing with Member States and is closely monitoring the situation, in line with the International Health Regulations (2005). This is the first report of a human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) infection globally and the case reported exposure to live backyard poultry before illness onset. Genetic analysis of this influenza A(H7N4) virus indicates that it is of avian origin. Close contacts of the case-patient tested negative for avian influenza A(H7N4) and remained asymptomatic. Current evidence suggests that this virus does not have the ability of sustained transmission to humans, thus the likelihood of sustained human to human transmission is low. Any animal influenza virus that develops the ability of human to human transmission can theoretically cause a pandemic. It is possible that additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N4) will be detected, however only one human case has been detected so far, and information on the circulation of avian influenza A(H7N4) in birds is not currently available. Further information needs to be gathered to increase the confidence in this assessment. The public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry feces.

The case was reported from a hospital in Dakar. The case travelled on 5 December 2017, with his brother and two colleagues, from Banjul, Gambia, to Ziguinchor, Senegal and from Ziguinchor to Buba in southern Guinea-Bissau. On 10 December, while being in Bissau (the capital of Guinea Bissau) the case developed symptoms, including a dry cough, fever, headache and joint pain. The brother of the case and the driver also developed a dry cough on 10 December, which resolved by the following day. The group arrived back in Gambia on 12 December after stopping in Ziguinchor. The case continued to have a persistent cough during this time. After returning to Banjul, the case also developed fever, headache and vertigo. The case was hospitalized on 20 December and diagnosed with severe malaria. Blood film for malaria revealed Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia above 100 000/µL. On 23 December, he became delirious and developed diarrhoea, vomiting and haemorrhagic symptoms. On 25 December, he entered into a coma and was medically evacuated to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. His symptoms improved and blood samples were taken on 26, 28 and 30 December. He experienced a recurrence of haemorrhagic symptoms on 31 December 2017 and died that same day. A blood sample from the case was tested at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar and was positive for IgM against Rift Valley fever virus. Rift Valley fever virus and other arboviruses were not detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The case had no known history of handling raw meat. The first case investigation was conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the Centre of Health Emergency Operations of the MoH of Senegal. As part of this investigation, blood samples were collected from the case’s brother, colleague and driver who experienced cough. These samples were all negative for Rift Valley Fever Virus by RT-PCR. In addition, a second case investigation was conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the Epidemic and Disease Control Unit of the MoH of Gambia in collaboration with the Department of Livestock Services of the Ministry of Agriculture. Rift Valley fever surveillance in the animal population and community awareness activities have been strengthened in Gambia. Rift Valley fever outbreaks are uncommon in Gambia and its neighbouring countries. The most recent human case reported in the Gambia occurred in 2002. Currently, there is no indication of a risk of a Rift Valley fever outbreak in Gambia, Senegal or Guinea-Bissau. Heavy rainfall, causing flooding and mass emergence of Rift Valley fever vectors is closely associated with Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Rift Valley fever can cause trade reductions and significant economic losses due to high mortality and abortion rates among infected ruminants. Integrated control measures that address both human and animal health are therefore necessary. These measures include educational campaigns for populations at risk. Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on: Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission by avoiding unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene and wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals is recommended. Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission by avoiding unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. In endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating. Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities, including insecticide spraying and the use of larvicide to reduce mosquito breeding sites, as well as the use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets, insect repellent, covering clothing and avoidance of outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species. Restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce the risk of spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas. Routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to provide early warning for veterinary and public health authorities. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Gambia based on the current information available on this event.

From 1 July 2017 through 16 February 2018, 464 confirmed human cases of yellow fever have been reported in Brazil, including 154 deaths. Confirmed cases were reported in São Paulo (181 cases, including 53 deaths), Minas Gerais (225 cases, including 76 deaths), and Rio de Janeiro (57 cases, including 24 deaths) states and in the Federal District (1 fatal case). Unlike the previous seasonal period, the current seasonal period has been characterized by more cases reported in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states along with the occurrence of cases in areas near large cities. In São Paulo State, 57% of the confirmed cases were likely to have been infected in Mairiporã Municipality (a rural area located 15km north of São Paulo Municipality). In Rio de Janeiro State, 45% of the confirmed cases were among residents of Valença and Teresópolis municipalities; the latter is located 96km from Rio de Janeiro City. Likely places where infections occurred for all of the confirmed cases correspond to areas with documented epizootics in non-human primates. In Minas Gerais, 47% of the confirmed cases reside in municipalities located south and southeast of the city of Belo Horizonte, where no human cases were detected during the outbreak in the 2016/2017 seasonal period. Two laboratory-confirmed cases of yellow fever (in France and in the Netherlands) have been reported among unvaccinated travellers who stayed in Brazil, in municipalities considered at-risk for yellow fever as described in the international travel health recommendations on the basis of the virus circulation, the distribution of yellow fever vectors and animal reservoirs. In addition, two laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in Argentinian citizens, likely to have been infected in Ilha Grande, municipality of Angra do Reis, state of Rio de Janeiro, and Isla Bella, state of São Paulo Brazil (both municipalities are known to be at risk for yellow fever). Furthermore, as of 26 February, three confirmed cases of yellow fever (two fatal) have been reported in Chilean citizens likely to also have been infected in Ilha Grande, municipality of Angra do Reis, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Epizootics have been reported continuously along the yellow fever pre-season and seasonal period, indicating sustained virus circulation in favourable ecosystem, which is expanding to areas previously not considered at risk for yellow fever. From 1 July 2017 through 6 February 2018, 3812 epizootics among non-human primates have been reported of which 517 have been laboratory-confirmed, 1157 remain under investigation, 1397 were classified as indeterminate, and 741 were ruled out. Epizootics have been reported in 22 of the 27 federal areas in the country. Epizootics with confirmed yellow fever circulation among non-human primates were reported in six states (Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Tocantins). São Paulo has accounted for 42% of the total epizootics. Additionally, the Brazil Ministry of Health reported the detection of yellow fever virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes captured in rural areas of two municipalities (Ituêta and Alvarenga) in Minas Gerais State in 2017 as part of an investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the Evandro Chagas Institute. The significance of this finding requires further investigation, particularly to confirm vector competence to transmit yellow fever. Since September 2017, when human cases of yellow fever and epizootics in non-human primates were confirmed in São Paulo State, national authorities have been intensifying vaccination activities through door-to-door vaccination and mass campaigns. In addition, state and municipality health authorities have been strengthening healthcare services for case management and carrying out risk communication activities. On 25 January 2018, Brazilian health authorities began a vaccination campaign (fractional and standard doses) targeting 69 municipalities within Rio de Janeiro (10 million persons in 15 municipalities) and São Paulo (10.3 million in 54 municipalities) states. As of 16 February 2018, preliminary results of the mass yellow fever vaccination campaign indicate that 4.3 million persons have been vaccinated for yellow fever (3.9 million persons with fractional doses and 379 900 persons with standard doses). This figure represents 21% of the planned over 20 million persons targeted for vaccination within the two states. Due to the low vaccination rate achieved during the campaign in Rio de Janeiro State (12.1% of the targeted population), state health authorities will extend the campaign. Similarly, in São Paulo State, only 29.6% of the targeted population has been vaccinated during the campaign and state health authorities are assessing the need to extend the campaign for several additional days. In Bahia, the vaccination campaign began on 19 February with a targeted population of 3.3 million persons in eight municipalities. The rapid increase in human cases and epizootics during recent weeks is concerning due to the persistence of virus circulation in at-risk areas and the spread to new areas, particularly near urban areas of large cities, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and in municipalities that were previously not considered at-risk for yellow fever. To date, yellow fever transmission by Aedes aegypti has not been documented in Brazil. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016/2017 outbreak in some of the affected states, isolated Haemagogus mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission. More recently, an investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of yellow fever virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes captured in rural areas of two municipalities in Minas Gerais (Ituêta and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation. The preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states indicate low vaccination coverage which suggests a significant number of persons remain at-risk and the necessity to intensify vaccination activities and risk communications among high-risk groups and hard-to-reach groups. The occurrence of two (possibly three) confirmed cases among unvaccinated travellers indicates the need for State Parties to reinforce the dissemination of recommendations for international travellers. Yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as Haemagogus and Sabethes. Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated. Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable, providing effective immunity against yellow fever within 10 days for more than 90% of people vaccinated and within 30 days for 99% of people vaccinated. A single dose provides lifelong protection. In the current outbreak in Brazil, all human cases of yellow fever have been linked to Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes. Basic precautions should be taken by people within and travelling to areas at risk for yellow fever. These include use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and trousers, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Travellers returning with viraemia may pose a risk for the establishment of local yellow fever transmission cycles predominantly in areas where the conditions for yellow fever transmission are present (including ecological factors and presence of the competent vector). WHO has updated its recommendations for international travellers on 16 January 2018. Urban transmission of yellow fever virus occurs when the virus is spread from human to human by the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942.

In order to ensure the safety of all staff deployed, as a precautionary measure, operations were scaled back for a few hours on election day. All normal operations have been fully restored as of 1 January 2019. After an intensification of field activities in early December, notable improvements can be observed in many areas, notably a decrease in cases in Beni. However, hard-earned progress could still be lost to rebound levels of transmission resulting from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts. During the reporting period (27 December 2018 – 2 January 2019), 16 newly confirmed cases were reported from Beni (two), Butembo (five), Katwa (three), Komanda (one), Mabalako (one), and Oicha (four) health zones (Figure 1). As of 2 January 2019, there have been a total of 609 EVD cases1 (561 confirmed and 48 probable, Figure 2), including 370 deaths and 208 people having recovered. Overall, cases are occurring in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri. Amongst confirmed and probable cases, the case load has been highest in females aged 15-49 who are eligible for vaccination (i.e. non-pregnant), and also females aged 50 years and older (Figure 3). Amongst confirmed and probable cases, 61% (374/609) were female (median age = 28) and were predominantly older than male cases (median age = 25.5). Of note, 16% (96/607) of cases were among children less than five years old, and 7% (41/607) were infants less than one year old. Most of the cases among children aged five years old or more were from Beni, 48% (46/96). There were 29 cases among pregnant women, of which 14 were from Beni. Fifteen of the 29 cases were reportedly breastfeeding women. As of 2 January, a total of 86 cases of nosocomial infection were reported in patients from the general public, primarily from Beni (34), Butembo (13), Katwa (11) and Mabalako (eight). There have been no new cases in healthcare workers during this reporting period. To date, there have been a total of 55 EVD cases involving healthcare workers, of which 18 have died and eight were hospitalised as patients. Of the healthcare workers with available clinical information, 36% (18/50) died. Eleven healthcare workers were reportedly infected in a general hospital while the other 30 health facilities reported between one to three cases each during the entire outbreak period. It should be noted that 22% (133/609) of all cases had history of exposure to a hospital 1-21 days prior to the onset of their illness. Thorough contact tracing during initial case investigations remains difficult in light of continued community resistance and the deteriorating security situation in the field during the recent elections. This resulted in a number of new confirmed cases not being identified as potential contacts. Of all cases, 66% (327/495) had known contact with a case, and 37% (177/478) had attended a funeral. A sizeable proportion of cases, 34% (155/451), had both these exposures. The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside of the above mentioned outbreak affected areas. The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened. For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information. As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond. International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Between 1 January and 22 December 2018, a total of 103 confirmed cases of hantavirus have been reported at the national level, 99 of which were reported in Los Santos Province. In Los Santos Province, 51 cases were classified as hantavirus fever1 (HF) without pulmonary syndrome and 48 cases were classified as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome2 (HPS), including four deaths. Of the 51 HF cases, 41% were female, 55% aged between 20-59 years, with 76% occurring between June 2018 and November 2018. Of the 48 HPS cases, 56% were female, 67% aged between 20-59 years, with more than half of the cases occurring in February 2018 (17%) and between June 2018 and September 2018 (42%). Four deaths were reported among HPS cases (two female, two male, all aged over 60 years). Cases were confirmed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)3. Sequencing determined that the type of virus associated with this outbreak is Choclo virus. It was first isolated in 1999 in the western Republic of Panama. Hantavirus cases have been reported in the Republic of Panama since 1999 (Figure 1). In the last five years, transmission has been documented in Los Santos, Herrera, Veraguas, and Cocle provinces. During 2018, cases have been reported in Los Santos (99 cases, Figure 2), Herrera (two cases), Cocle (one case) and Veraguas (one case) provinces (Figure 3). Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents and transmission can occur when people come in contact with rodent habitats, the current increase in hantavirus cases in the Republic of Panama could be related to changes in the abundance and distribution of rodent species, as well as strengthened surveillance and laboratory capacity at the provincial level. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. The public health responses currently being implemented include: Investigation and monitoring of cases, including case management. Enhanced surveillance and active case finding. Rodent control and mitigation measures. Increasing awareness and health promotion in the affected areas. HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. Infections are acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with the excreta, droppings or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (forests, fields, farms, etc.), where rodents hosting the virus might be found. Infected individuals may experience headache, dizziness, chills, fever and myalgia. They may also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, and diarrhoea, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure, though symptoms may appear as early as one week to as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case fatality rate can reach 50%. In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. In January 2019, World Youth Day4 will be hosted in the Republic of Panama. This mass gathering will take place predominantly in Panama City, while side events will occur in other provinces5. Though a seasonal increase of hantavirus during the month of January has not been previously documented, increases in cases have been related to outdoor and agricultural activities in rural environments. Nevertheless, participants to the World Youth Day should be provided with recommendations and guidance on how to take appropriate precautionary measures to reduce their risk of infection. Health awareness campaigns for health personnel and the general public are planned for the coming weeks. Organisers and public health authorities should collaborate with travel and tourism sectors in placing educational materials and appropriate signage at strategic locations and points of entry (e.g. airports, public transport stations, travel agent offices). Alternative forms of media including public service announcements on planes, ships and public radio should also be considered. Based on current epidemiological data and public health response, WHO’s risk assessment is that there is no significant risk of international spread of HPS in relation to this event. PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus. Particular attention should be paid to travellers returning from the affected areas, who are advised to report their travel history, as early identification and timely medical care can improve clinical outcomes. Care during the initial stages of the illness should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on the patient's haemodynamic monitoring, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICUs). Health awareness campaigns should aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people’s contact with rodents. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. While most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposing travellers to rodents or their excreta, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials. HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. WHO recommends the implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations. Throughout the World Youth Day event, syndromic surveillance may alert public authorities to increased influenza-like and GI symptoms among mass gathering participants. At this time, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Republic of Panama based on available information for the current hantavirus outbreak.

The first case was a 11-year old child who experienced onset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 6 October. The second case was a 29-month old child who experienced onset of symptoms on 7 October, and is a known contact of the first case. The isolated viruses are a new emergence and unrelated to previously-detected cVDPV2s affecting the country. This is the fourth distinct outbreak of cVDPV2 detected in the country since June 2017. In total, 42 cVDPV2 cases have now been confirmed since detection of the first outbreak in June 2017, 20 cases of which were detected in 2018. In February 2018, the government declared cVDPV2 to be a national public health emergency. On 26 July 2018, the Minister of Health, WHO Director General, the Regional Director for Africa, and provincial governors convened an urgent, high-level meeting and signed the ‘Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication’. Provincial governors pledged to provide the necessary oversight, accountability and resources required to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. It is imperative that the remaining operational gaps in outbreak response are urgently filled with the appropriate oversight and engagement. WHO and partners are responding in accordance with international outbreak response protocols including through administration of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2). However, operational gaps such as the under-immunization of high-risk populations, continue to hamper the full implementation of these protocols. Thus, the response so far has not adequately controlled the outbreak nor prevented its spread. The recent emergence of the fourth outbreak of cVDPV2 from Haut Katanga can potentially be attributed to the prior use of mOPV2 and may be related to the response program’s current limited capacity to adapt effectively and implement necessary corrective measures in a timely manner. With the evidence of geographic spread of some of these strains and emergence of the new strain, two large scale rounds of mOPV2 were administered in September 2018 and October 2018 targeting around 12 million children in 16 of 26 provinces of the country. Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries. The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to the ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province to the east of the country. Polio outbreak response teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner. Currently, WHO finds the overall national public health risk associated with these four outbreaks to be very high. The risk of international spread, particularly to the neighboring countries also remains high due to the continuation of these outbreaks close to international borders. This risk is magnified by known population movements between the affected areas of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Central African Republic, Zambia and South Sudan. As of July 2018, in light of the epidemiology of the reported polio cases, genetic analyses of the isolated polioviruses, risk of further in-country and international spread, and the country’s response capacity, the outbreak has been graded as a Grade 2 public health emergency based on the WHO Emergency Response Framework. The detection of cVDPV2s underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage to minimize the risk and consequences of poliovirus circulation. These events also highlight the risks posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is necessary to impede further disease transmission, ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas, and prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to monitor and evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents and visitors staying for more than four- weeks in affected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel. Efforts should also be made to ensure that individuals who received vaccinations are provided the appropriate documentation to record their vaccination status. As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency. At this time, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the basis of the information available for the current cVDPV2 outbreaks. Cross border activities should be conducted between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries to strengthen AFP surveillance and routine immunization as well as operations linked to the control of other vaccine preventable diseases. Direct and regular collaboration between neighboring provinces and districts should begin quickly awaiting formal administrative and political address.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["poliomyelitis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2018-10-06 xx:xx:xx to 2018-10-07 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "Africa", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "state": "Kongo Central", "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "state": "North-Kivu", "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "state": "Katanga", "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Rwanda", "state": "Kigali City", "city": "Kigali"}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "state": "Orientale", "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "state": "Katanga", "city": "Sampwe"}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "state": "Kinshasa", "city": "Kinshasa"}, {"continent": "Africa", "country": "South Sudan", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "Arkansas", "city": "Little Rock"}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/09-january-2019-yellow-fever-nigeria/en/", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-09", "headline": "Yellow fever – Nigeria", "main_text": "On 22 November 2018, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of suspected Yellow fever (YF) cases and deaths in Edo State, Nigeria. Edo State is located less than 400km from Lagos on a dense population movement axis between Lagos and South-Eastern Nigeria. Edo State is also a known endemic area for Lassa fever – which was initially suspected as causing the outbreak. From 22 September through 31 December 2018, a total of 146 suspected, 42 presumptive positive, and 32 confirmed cases, including 26 deaths (presumptive case fatality rate: 18%), have been reported across 15 of 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Edo State (figure 1). Blood specimens were obtained from 122 cases and sent for laboratory diagnosis; 42 (34%) samples were presumptive positive in-country based on IgM serology and sent to the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD), for confirmation. Thirty-two (76%) were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Males represent the majority of cases (108 of 146, 74%), and the most affected age group is 10–19 years with 48 cases (33%), followed by the age group 20–29 with 36 cases (25%). Initially, the affected LGAs were rural but since the end of November 2018, suspected cases have been reported from three urban LGAs. There has also been a report of two presumptive positive and one confirmed case in Oredo LGA, which includes the densely populated state capital Benin City, of about 1.5 million inhabitants. At the time of the outbreak, population immunity in Edo State was very low, (based solely on routine immunisation administrative data, with vaccine coverage estimated at less than 50% in 2018). Edo State has just concluded a seven-day YF Reactive Vaccination Campaign implementation in 13 LGAs to rapidly boost population immunity and interrupt YF transmission. As of 31 December 2018, 1.47 million people have been vaccinated. Entomological studies have revealed elevated indices of competent vectors, including Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species responsible for rapid amplification of arboviral disease in urban environments. Land-use practices, namely cultivation close to dwellings, may further exacerbate the spread of YF disease in this setting. Since September 2017, when the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) informed WHO of a confirmed case of YF in Kwara State, Nigeria has been responding to successive YF outbreaks. The country officially notified WHO (via the International Health Regulations, 2005) on 15 September 2017. Since then, and as of 30 December 2018, 237 specimens tested IgM positive in-country. Eighty-two cases (including 13 deaths) were confirmed by IPD; these cases were reported from 27 LGAs in 14 States and have resulted in response campaigns in selected LGAs in six states. The current outbreak of YF in Edo State in Nigeria is unusual in scale and severity, and the number of cases in time and place is very high in the context of the current national outbreak. The seasonal timing of the outbreak, in a period where many travellers enter the state from other states and countries for the holidays in December–January, adds to the risk for potential spread. The response to the outbreak is being coordinated through a multi-agency, multi-partner Incident Management System (IMS). A national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to monitor the outbreak at the NCDC. Rapid response teams continue to support Edo State in ongoing outbreak investigation and response. YF surveillance has been intensified and active case finding is ongoing in affected LGAs and neighbouring states. Supervisory visits to the YF laboratory network are ongoing to strengthen laboratory capacity. The WHO Country Office and State Office have been actively monitoring and responding to the YF outbreak since the start of the outbreak. From 15 December 2018, three YF experts from WHO (WHO Regional Office for Africa and WHO headquarters) were deployed to support local authorities in investigating this event, assessing the risk of further amplification, and assisting in conducting reactive vaccination campaigns, among other activities. Entomological surveys were conducted in Anambra, Benue, Ekiti, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kwara, Rivers, and Zamfara states by entomologists from the National Arbovirus Research Institute (NARI). A vector control strategy, tailored to the local context, is being developed with the support of WHO regional and global vector control experts. Routine YF vaccination was introduced to Nigeria’s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004, but the overall population immunity in areas affected by the current outbreak remains below herd immunity thresholds. National preventive and reactive mass vaccination campaigns have been conducted in the country since 2017 (~33 million doses). A proposal has been submitted to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to vaccinate twelve states over the next three years (~23 million doses). The International Coordination Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance approved release of 3.1 million doses of YF vaccines. The country initiated a large scale reactive yellow fever vaccination campaign in Edo State on 18 December, initially using in-country vaccine stocks which were mobilised to facilitate a timely response before the holidays. YF is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommended. The YF outbreak has been active in Nigeria since September 2017. Cases are reported from 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The recent confirmation by the regional reference laboratory of the YF outbreak in Edo State, with the probable epicentre in Uhunmwonde LGA, represents an unprecedented outbreak in Nigeria. Given the rapid evolution of the situation in Edo State, the national risk is assessed as high due to: the high presumptive case fatality rate (33%) in Edo State; the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification due to low vaccination coverage; presence of competent vectors including Aedes sp.; the proximity of a case to Benin City (major urban centre and capital of Edo State); and the potential spread to new LGAs. There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected states to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries and particularly if there is arrival of unvaccinated visitors over the festive end of year season. The current overall risk is low at the global level. Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including cholera, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, monkey pox, measles, and Lassa fever outbreaks in other states, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country. Nigeria is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Phased preventive YF vaccination campaigns are planned to cover the entire country by 2024. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of YF. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak. WHO recommends vaccination against YF for all international travellers more than nine months of age going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic YF virus transmission. Nigeria also requires a YF vaccination certificate for travellers over one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission. YF vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against YF extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved YF vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry. WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of YF symptoms and signs and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of YF transmission in areas where the competent vector is present. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.

A decline in case incidence has been seen in Beni, the former epicentre. This is a strong positive indication of how effective the response can be despite multiple challenges. However, in Beni and elsewhere, trends must be interpreted cautiously, as delayed detection of cases is expected following recent temporary disruption in response activities due to insecurity. Nevertheless, WHO and partners remain committed, under the government’s leadership and through collaboration across agencies, to addressing challenges and ending the outbreak. As of 8 January 2019, there have been a total of 628 EVD cases1 (580 confirmed and 48 probable), including 383 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 61%). Thus far, 222 people have recovered, been discharged from an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. During the last 21 days (19 December 2018 to 8 January 2019), cases have been reported from ten health zones where the outbreak remains active, including: Katwa (18), Butembo (16), Oicha (13), Beni (13), Kalungata (6), Mabalako (5), Komanda (3), Musienene (2), Kyondo (1) and Nyankunde (1). Overall, cases have occurred in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 1). Surveillance activities are being maintained to rapidly detect resurgences or reintroduction events in all areas. Trends in numbers of new cases occurring (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas, with encouraging declines in case incidence in areas such as Beni. Hard-earned progress could still be lost from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts. Amongst confirmed and probable EVD cases, 61% (385/628) were female and 30% (189/628) were children aged less than 18 years. This includes a high number of cases in infants aged less than 1 year (38) and 1-4 years (58). While investigations to understand the risk factors for this disproportionate burden are ongoing, response teams continue to prioritise these population groups to mitigate, wherever possible, the risk of transmission. All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and in a traveller returning from Burundi to Sweden. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. International travellers who may have come into contact with the virus, including a doctor who returned to the United States of America after providing medical assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also being followed closely; all remain asymptomatic. The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond. International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Details of these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below). MERS-CoV cases reported between 1 December and 31 December 2018xls, 115kb From 2012 through 31 December 2018, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported globally to WHO under IHR (2005) is 2 279 with 806 associated deaths. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["mers-cov"], "syndromes": ["Acute respiratory syndrome"], "event_date": "2018-12-01 xx:xx:xx to 2018-12-31 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "California", "city": "Fremont"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "Canada", "state": "Ontario", "city": "Toronto"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "Dubai", "city": "Dubai"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "دبي", "city": "دبي"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "state": null, "city": null}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2019-measles-madagascar/en/", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-17", "headline": "Measles – Madagascar", "main_text": "WHO is supporting the Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar to respond to an unusually large measles outbreak. Madagascar last experienced measles outbreaks in 2003 and 2004, with reported number of cases at 62 233 and 35 558, respectively. Since then, the number of reported cases had sharply declined until the current outbreak. From 4 October 2018 to 7 January 2019, 19 539 measles cases and 39 “facility-based” deaths (case fatality ratio: 0.2%) have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) of Madagascar. Cases were reported from 66 of 114 total districts in all 22 regions of Madagascar. Among the 19 539 measles cases, 375 have been laboratory confirmed (all are IgM+) and 19 164 were confirmed by epidemiological link. Cases confirmed by epidemiological link are those who presented clinical symptoms based on the case definition and had been in contact with another laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked case. The outbreak has spread to densely populated urban cities including Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsirabe, Toliara and the capital city Antananarivo. Most cases were reported from Analamanga (61%) and Boeny (20%) regions. The highest attack rates were observed in Antananarivo-Renivohitra district (714 per 100 000 inhabitants), and Ambato-Boina district (668 per 100 000 inhabitants), in Analamanga and Mahajanga regions, respectively. These rates are considerably higher compared to the national attack rate of 108 per 100 000 inhabitants. In the current epidemic, children aged 1 to 14 years account for 64% of the total number of cases. The age distribution in this group is as follows: under five years at 35%, 5-9 years at 22% and 10-14 years at 19%. Both sexes are equally affected with a male to female ratio of 1.04. The national immunization programme recommends routine measles immunization for children aged nine months. According to WHO and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the estimated measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. More than half of the cases (51%) reported during the current outbreak have not been vaccinated or have unknown immunization status. Madagascar has the highest proportion of malnutrition among children under five (47%) in the African region which can increase children's risk of serious complications and death from measles infection. The circulating genotype for the current measles outbreak in Madagascar is B3, usually found in Africa and Europe. No measles cases with travel history to Madagascar, however, have been reported in neighboring countries and initial investigations in Madagascar have not shown any link with cases from countries with measles outbreak in the Africa region or Europe. The measles outbreak has occurred concurrently with the resurgence of plague in the country—which reoccurs seasonally—straining the public health response. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public Health response measures include: Enhancement of active surveillance (active case finding, community-based surveillance, distribution of specimen collection kits) in all affected districts. Use of the Global Measles Programmatic Risk Assessment Tool to target priority districts for vaccination. Completion of targeted vaccination campaigns: Campaign conducted from 22 October to 9 November 2018 in four districts of Antanavarivo city. The campaign targeted at least 95% of children aged between nine and 59 months. Preliminary results show coverage of 84% of the targeted population. Campaign planned from 14 to 18 January targeting 2 083 734 children aged between nine months and nine years in 25 districts across 13 regions. The campaign is being funded by Measles Rubella Initiative (MRI), the Government of Madagascar, WHO, UNICEF, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Commission de l'Océan Indien (COI), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Embassy of France in Madagascar and the World Bank and the total cost is US$ 2 355 989. Reinforcement of routine immunization (one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) as per the national immunization programme) for children aged between nine and 11 months. Continued management of severe measles cases in referral hospitals, provided to patients free of charge. Vitamin A is being administered to patients under care in all referral and district health centres. Continued community mobilization with the support of UNICEF and USAID, aiming to increase understanding of the disease as well as uptake of the vaccines from campaigns and routine vaccination. Reactivation by USAID of the 910 hotline, formerly used during the 2017 plague epidemic, for information sharing on measles. Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease that has potential to lead to major epidemics. Low coverage with measles vaccine combined with a low incidence of measles in recent years in Madagascar has contributed to a significant proportion of the population which is susceptible to measles. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, the measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. The malnutrition rate is also a contributor as malnutrition increases children's vulnerability of serious complications and death from measles infection. WHO estimates the overall risk for Madagascar from this measles outbreak to be very high. Currently, several concomitant factors are likely to hinder or delay public health intervention and might jeopardize the response: post-election conflict, geographical isolation and remoteness of cases, insecurity, hurricane season and multiple outbreaks. Targeted immunization campaigns and strengthening of routine immunization activities are paramount in the effective control of the outbreak. Administration of Vitamin A, specifically in a context of high rates of malnutrition, can reduce illness and deaths from measles infection. The risk at the regional level is low although the spread of measles to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other African countries and Europe cannot be excluded. Strengthening of surveillance in neighboring countries is recommended. The overall global risk is considered to be low. WHO urges all Member States to: Vaccinate to maintain coverage of 95% with two doses of MCV. Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.), and international travelers. Maintain a reserve of MCV and syringes for control of imported cases in each country in the region. Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of fever or rash cases for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within five days of being taken. Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the establishment or reestablishment of endemic transmission. Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (50,000 IU for a child less than 6 months of age, 100,000 IU for children 6-12 months of age or 200,000 IU for children 12-59 months); two doses, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day). WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and or trade to Madagascar based on the information available on the current outbreak.

An additional 17 cases, all of whom were epidemiologically-linked to previously confirmed cases, experienced symptom onset between 7 December 2018 and 3 January 2019 (Figure 1). Potential human-to-human transmission is currently under investigation. Of the confirmed cases, 59% were female, and had an incubation period ranging from 8 to 31 days. Approximately 50% of these confirmed cases reported symptoms within the past three weeks. Cases were confirmed by ELISA IgM u-captura or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As of 17 January 2019, a total of 98 asymptomatic contacts have been identified and are being monitored for the potential development of symptoms. In Argentina, four endemic regions have been identified: North (Salta, Jujuy), Centro (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Ríos), Northeast (Misiones) and Sur (Neuquén, Río Negro, and Chubut). Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 100 confirmed cases were registered annually, with the provinces of Buenos Aires, Salta, and Jujuy having the highest numbers of cases. Between 2013 and 2018, 114 confirmed deaths from hantavirus were reported in Argentina, with a case-fatality rate of 18.6%, though this figure was close to 40% for some provinces in the southern region of the country. In Chile, one of the confirmed cases was a healthcare worker who resides in Palena Province, Los Lagos Region, and reported experiencing symptoms on 2 January 2019. The case had a travel history to Epuyén for one day in mid-November, and later hosted and cared for a confirmed case from Epuyén while she was in her prodromal phase. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in Los Lagos Region in 2019. During 2018, there were eight cases of hantavirus reported in Chile, including two deaths. Health authorities in Argentina and Chile are implementing the following public health measures: Enhanced surveillance and active case finding including increase local diagnostic capacities for hantavirus for early diagnosis Daily follow-up of contacts Deployments of multi-disciplinary teams to the affected areas for outbreak investigation Environmental control measures Conduct risk communication activities; including educational awareness and health promotion in the communities and in healthcare facilities Implementation of infection prevention and control measures Safe case management of HPS patient in dedicated health care facilities HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic rodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to the virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one week and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can reach 35-50%. In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents, mainly Sigmodontinae species, transmission can occur when people come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human transmission of HPS due to Andes virus in Argentina has been previously documented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient isolation. Standard precautions1 should always be put in place, as well as rodent control measures. PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus. Particular attention should be paid towards travelers returning from the affected areas. Early identification and timely medical care greatly improves clinical outcomes. To raise awareness regarding potential HPS cases, clinicians should consult epidemiological data for guidance of the possible exposure, and be vigilant of patients presenting with suspicious clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. Care during the initial stages of the disease should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICU). Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, is not approved for either treatment or prophylaxis of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infection. Health awareness campaigns must aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people’s exposure. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. Most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposure of travelers to rodents or their excreta. However, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking, should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials. HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. The implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations, is recommended. References: 1 Standard precautions refer to a set of practices that are applied to the care of patients, regardless of the state of infection (suspicion or confirmation), in any place where health services are provided. These practices aim to protect both healthcare professionals and patients and include: hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, safe handling of sharps materials, safe injection practices, use of sterile instruments and equipment and cleaning of hospital environments and the environment.

The number of reported cases increased during recent weeks, most notably from the Katwa health zone where response teams have faced pockets of community mistrust. The outbreak has also extended southwards to Kayina health zone, a high security risk area. Teams are working actively to build community trust and scale up response activities around these new clusters. Figure 1 shows that as of 22 January 2019, there have been a total of 713 EVD cases1 (664 confirmed and 49 probable), including 439 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%). Thus far, 247 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs), with many having enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (420/710) of cases were female, and 30% (214/708) were aged less than 18 years; including 108 infants and children under 5 years. Sixty-one healthcare workers have been infected to date. During the last 21 days (2 January – 22 January 2019), 102 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (62), Butembo (12), Oicha (6), Kayina (5), Beni (2), Manguredjipa (3), Kyondo (3), Kalungata (2), Komanda (1), Musienene (2), Biena (2), Mabalako (1), and Vuhovi (1). The current outbreak hotspots of Butembo and Katwa encompass an urban area with a population of approximately one million people. Of the 148 cases reported in Katwa to date, less than half (55/148) were registered as contacts at the time of illness onset. Moreover, 10% (14/148) of these cases comprised of healthcare workers, and among those with available information, 42% (45/107) reported having attended a funeral in the weeks prior to illness onset. Collectively, these figures suggest that the observed increase in Katwa is being driven by a combination of both healthcare facility and community-based transmissions. Health protection and control measures such as infection prevention and control in health centers, vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, and safe and dignified burial practices, are being strengthened to interrupt the chains of transmission. The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond. International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

As of 3 January 2020, a total of 44 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology have been reported to WHO by the national authorities in China. Of the 44 cases reported, 11 are severely ill, while the remaining 33 patients are in stable condition. According to media reports, the concerned market in Wuhan was closed on 1 January 2020 for environmental sanitation and disinfection. The causal agent has not yet been identified or confirmed. On 1 January 2020, WHO requested further information from national authorities to assess the risk. National authorities report that all patients are isolated and receiving treatment in Wuhan medical institutions. The clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever, with a few patients having difficulty in breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs. According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker infections have been reported. National authorities have reported the following response measures: One hundred and twenty-one close contacts have been identified and are under medical observation; The follow-up of close contacts is ongoing; Pathogen identification and the tracing of the cause are underway; Wuhan Municipal Health Commission carried out active case finding, and retrospective investigations have been completed; Environmental sanitation and further hygiene investigations are under way. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China. There is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology. The reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals. The symptoms reported among the patients are common to several respiratory diseases, and pneumonia is common in the winter season; however, the occurrence of 44 cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization clustered in space and time should be handled prudently.

The case is a 74-year-old male national who owns a camel farm located in Al Ain City, Abu Dhabi region in UAE where he is living. He developed fever, cough and sore throat on 8 December 2019 and was admitted to hospital on 10 December, then transferred to ICU on 16 December. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (UpE and Orf1a genes) on 16 December by the Shiekh Khalifa Medical Center laboratory. He has underlying comorbidities including hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, heart disease, asthma and hypertension. He has a history of close contact with dromedary camels and sheep at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He has no history of recent travel and has not been involved in slaughtering animals. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in intensive care unit isolation. Since 2012, UAE has reported 89 cases of MERS-CoV (including this case) and 12 associated deaths. From 2012 through 29 December 2019, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2494 with 858 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states. Upon identification of the patient, an incident report, case investigation and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation is ongoing and includes screening of all close contacts, including occupational contacts in his farm, household contacts and healthcare workers at the hospital where he sought care. All identified contacts of the confirmed case will be monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the confirmed case. A total of 88 contacts have been identified, including 70 health care contacts and 18 household contacts. All close contacts of the patient were tested negative for MERS-CoV. The veterinary authorities have been notified and investigations for MERS-CoV in animals are ongoing. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated limited ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["mers-cov"], "syndromes": ["Fever of unknown Origin", "Acute respiratory syndrome"], "event_date": "2019-12-08 xx:xx:xx to 2019-12-29 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "California", "city": "Fremont"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": null, "city": null}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "Abu Dhabi", "city": "Al Ain"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "United States", "state": "California", "city": "San Diego"}, {"continent": "North America", "country": "Canada", "state": "Ontario", "city": "Toronto"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "Lebanon", "state": "Mount Lebanon Governorate", "city": "Hadath"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "Dubai", "city": "Dubai"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "Abu Dhabi", "city": "Abu Dhabi"}, {"continent": "Asia", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "state": "دبي", "city": "دبي"}]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/09-january-2020-ebola-drc/en/", "date_of_publication": "2020-01-09", "headline": "Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "Twelve new confirmed cases were reported from 1 to 7 January in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces.

Of the confirmed cases, forty-nine cases (40%) were hospitalized, 12 were among health care workers, and seventy-five (60%) were males. Gaza Strip has an estimated population of 1.99 million (Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics-2019). In addition, of the confirmed cases, 57 cases (46%) were un-vaccinated, of which 28 (23%) were among infants between 6 months to one year old, and 29 (23%) among age groups higher than 30 years old. Between 2009 and 2018, the median administrative immunization coverage for the second dose of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV2) was 97%. The immunization strategy in the Gaza Strip includes measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine given to children at 12 and 18 months of age (MMR introduced in 1988 as single dose, and second dose introduced at 18 months of age in 2009). Since the establishment of the indicator-based surveillance in the Gaza Strip in 1986, no measles cases were reported in Gaza Strip except one confirmed case in 2000. The following response measures have been taken by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Gaza Strip: Strengthened surveillance systems for suspect cases with fever and rash; Initiated the early notification of suspect cases by the Central Preventive Medicine; Continued maintenance of high levels of immunity with two doses of MMR vaccination in the community; Health authorities in the Gaza Strip began MMR vaccination of all health care workers in four public hospitals where measles cases were admitted and treated. An estimated 900 health care workers were vaccinated on 13 December 2019. WHO country office (WCO) is supporting the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the Gaza Strip in the following response activities: Procured 10 kits (for 9000 tests) for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) after the first two confirmed cases in Gaza Strip; Measles awareness material for health care workers and the public were printed and distributed; A measles sensitization meeting was held for 100 health care workers on case definition and clinical management in October 2019; WCO with support from Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) provided a Rubella kit to test the measles negative cases with measles symptoms; Supporting transport of the samples from Gaza Strip to Ramallah referral laboratory; Supplementary Immunization activities (SIA) has been recommended by WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) for all affected age-groups and health care workers. The Gaza Strip has maintained a high administrative coverage of 97% for MCV2 between 2009 and 2018, with a good reporting rate of 4.5 per 100,000 population. However, with the continuous socio-economic decline, conflict and closure, the Gaza Strip may be challenged with this unusual high number of measles cases in 2019. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10–12 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one or several of the following: runny nose, conjunctivitis, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious 4 days before the start of the rash to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. Most people recover within 2–3 weeks. WHO recommends that strong surveillance at the district level should be maintained in Gaza Strip to control the transmission of the disease. Immunization is the most effective preventive measure against measles. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, vitamin A should be administered to all acute cases irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A. Two doses of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV) to ensure immunity: first dose, by 9 to 12 months; second dose, in second year of life. The minimum interval between the two doses should not be less than one month; Maintaining high measles vaccination coverage (≥ 95%) in every district; Offer vaccination to individuals who do not have proof of vaccination or immunity against measles, and who are at risk of infection and transmission of the virus, such as healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation, and international travelers; Strengthen epidemiological surveillance for cases of ‘fever with rash’ for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities; Ensure that collected blood samples from suspect measles cases appropriately tested by laboratories within five days; Recognize complications early and provide comprehensive treatment to reduce the severity of disease and avoid unnecessary deaths; Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (two doses of 50, 000 IU for a child less than 6 month of age, 100, 000 IU for children between 6 to 12 months of age or 200, 000 IU for children 12-59 months, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day; Ensure health care workers are vaccinated in order to avoid infections acquired in a health care setting; Adequate capacity for case management especially for complicated cases to help mitigate the mortality.

WHO is reassured of the quality of the ongoing investigations and the response measures implemented in Wuhan, and the commitment to share information regularly. The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan. The market was closed on 1 January 2020. At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission. The Chinese authorities continue their work of intensive surveillance and follow up measures, as well as further epidemiological investigations. Among the 41 confirmed cases, there has been one death. This death occurred in a patient with serious underlying medical conditions. China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus on 12 January, which will be of great importance for other countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits. The cluster was initially reported on 31 December 2019, when the WHO China Country Office was informed. The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus (novel coronavirus, nCoV), which was isolated on 7 January 2020. Laboratory testing was conducted on all suspected cases identified through active case finding and retrospective review. Other respiratory pathogens such as influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were ruled out as the cause. According to information conveyed to WHO by Chinese authorities on 11 and 12 January, 41 cases with novel coronavirus infection have been preliminarily diagnosed in Wuhan City. Of the 41 cases reported, seven are severely ill. This is when the one death, mentioned above, was reported, in a patient with other underlying health conditions. Six patients have been discharged from hospital. Symptom onset of the 41 confirmed nCoV cases ranges from 8 December 2019 to 2 January 2020. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020. The clinical signs and symptoms reported are mainly fever, with a few cases having difficulty in breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive pneumonic infiltrates in both lungs. National authorities report that patients have been isolated and are receiving treatment in Wuhan medical institutions. According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, most cases worked at or were handlers and frequent visitors to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The government reports that there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person. Currently, no case with infection of this novel coronavirus has been reported elsewhere other than Wuhan. China's National Health Commission has deployed a group of experts to Wuhan City to support the local response. National authorities have reported the following response measures: A total of 763 close contacts including healthcare workers, have been identified and followed up and no additional cases of infection with the novel coronavirus have been identified; The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission carried out active case finding, and retrospective investigations of the current cluster of patients have been completed The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has been temporarily closed to carry out environmental sanitation and disinfection; Public risk communication activities have been carried out to improve public awareness and adoption of self-protection measures. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in regular contact with national authorities in China to provide support required. Technical guidance on novel coronavirus has been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information is available. To date, investigations are still under way to assess the full extent of the outbreak. Wuhan city is a major domestic and international transport hub. To date, there have been no reported cases outside of Wuhan City. More comprehensive information and ongoing investigations are also required to better understand the epidemiology, clinical picture, source, modes of transmission, and extent of infection; as well as the countermeasures implemented. Based on information provided by national authorities, WHO’s recommendations on public health measures and surveillance for novel coronaviruses apply. WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with their healthcare provider. Travel guidance has been updated. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available on this event.

The case is a 61-year-old Chinese woman living in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On 5 January 2020, she developed fever with chills, sore throat and headache. On 8 January 2020, she took a direct flight to Thailand from Wuhan City together with five family members in a tour group of 16 people. The traveler with febrile illness was detected on the same day by thermal surveillance at Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK), Thailand, and was hospitalized the same day. After temperature check and initial assessment, she was transferred to the hospital for further investigations and treatment. The patient’s full exposure history is under investigation. She reported a history of visiting a local fresh market in Wuhan on regular basis prior to the onset of illness on 5 January 2020; however, she did not report visiting the Huanan South China Seafood Market from where most of the cases were detected. Samples tested positive for coronaviruses by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 12 January 2020. The genomic sequencing analysis performed by Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Center, the Thai Red Cross Society (EID-TRC) and the Thai National Institute of Health (Thai NIH), Department of Medical Sciences confirmed that the patient was infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which was isolated in Wuhan, China (for more information, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 12 January 2020 ). As of this writing, the patient is in a stable condition and in hospital. The Ministry of Public Health Thailand implemented measures for screening travelers from Wuhan city on 3 January 2020 at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Don Mueang, Phuket and Chiang Mai airports, and activated enhanced surveillance at public and private hospitals. Since the identification of the case on 5 January 2019, Thai health authorities have taken the following measures: Eight febrile travelers were detected by a thermo-scan at Suvarnabhumi Airport. They have been isolated and tested, and none of them have been confirmed with 2019-nCov infection. A total of 182 contacts were identified and are being monitored. The contacts were fellow passengers as well as members of the same tour group. Only one contact developed respiratory symptoms and the PCR test of throat swab yields positive for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Risk communication guidance has been shared with the public and a hotline has been established by the Department of Disease Control for people returning from the affected area in China with related symptoms. The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand has international-standard diagnosis and medical care, and is closely coordinating with WHO and related departments for the potential response measures. This is the first exported case of novel coronavirus from Wuhan city, China. Since the initial report of cases in Wuhan city on 31 December 2019, 41 cases have a preliminary diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection, including 1 death in a person with severe underlying medical conditions (for more information, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 12 January 2020 ). As the traveler did not report having visited the market linked to most of the other cases, it is vital that investigations continue to identify the source of infection. To date, China has not reported any cases of infection among healthcare workers or contacts of the cases. Based on the available information there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020 in China. Additional investigation is needed to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected. It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the potential transmissibility among humans. Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travelers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry.

The confirmed cases were reported from Mabalako (64%, n=9), Beni (29%, n=4) and Musienene (7%, n=1) Health Zones in North Kivu Province. All new confirmed cases (100%, 14/14) reported in the past seven days were registered contacts prior to symptom onset and had epidemiological links to the transmission chain which originated from Aloya Health Area in Mabalako Health Zone. In the past 21 days (25 December 2019 to 14 January 2020), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 14 health areas within seven active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (43%, n=17), Butembo (20%, n=8), Beni (13%, n=5), Mambasa (10%, n=4), Kalunguta (8%, n=3), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Musienene (3%, n=1). Mabalako Health Zone remains the current hotspot of the outbreak, having reported 43% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. The majority of cases (88%, 35/40) reported from this period are linked to known chains of transmission, which is similar to the period from 4 to 24 December 2019 (89%, 47/53). In the past 21 days, 8% (3/36) of the confirmed EVD deaths were people who died in the community, outside of Ebola treatment centres. From these three community deaths, 15 additional cases occurred, which reinforces the need for continued activities to follow contacts, detect symptomatic patients as early as possible, and engage communities in response efforts. As of 14 January, a total of 3406 EVD cases were reported, including 3288 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2236 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1910) were female, 28% (n=960) were children aged less than 18 years, and 169 (5% of all reported cases) were health care workers. In the coming week, there will be nine health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces that will have contacts in or entering their high-risk period (seven to 13 days after last exposure to the virus). In Kalunguta Health Zone, North Kivu Province, where five individuals were confirmed with EVD from 24 to 28 December 2019, all 153 contacts have cleared their 21-day follow-up, with no new cases reported. In Mambasa Health Zone, Ituri Province, where four new cases were reported from 4 to 5 January 2020, more than 400 followed contacts are nearing the end of their high-risk period. It has been more than 17 months since the outbreak was first declared on 1 August 2018. The number of cases reported per week is lower than the period from March to September 2019 (Figure 1). However, there are several health areas which are difficult to reach due to insecurity, including Mandima Health Zone, where there are rumours of several community deaths in Lwemba Health Area. Continued response efforts in active health zones, including in insecure areas, and preventing reintroduction of the disease into health zones with dense populations which have previously been cleared are crucial to ending ongoing transmission. For further information about public health response actions by the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. Any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Since the initial report of cases in Wuhan city on 31 December 2019, and as of 12 January 2020, 41 laboratory-confirmed cases of nCoV infection, including 2 deaths in cases with underlying medical conditions have been reported to WHO. Two cases have been reported from Thailand. The source of the outbreak is still under investigation in Wuhan. Preliminary investigations have identified environmental samples positive for nCoV in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City, however some laboratory-confirmed patients did not report visiting this market. To date, there is no reported infection among healthcare workers in China, Thailand or Japan. No additional cases have been reported since 3 January in China. Additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, whether human-to-human transmission has been observed, mode(s) of transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the extent of infection, including presence of subclinical cases that are undetected with current surveillance. It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the extent of transmissibility between people and likelihood of zoonotic spillover. Although the source of the novel coronavirus causing this cluster of pneumonia and the mode(s) of transmission are unknown, it would be prudent to remind populations and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections: Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment; Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals; People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands); Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments; WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Travel guidance has been updated. Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travellers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry. WHO has provided interim guidance for novel coronaviruses WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Japan based on the information currently available on this event.
